<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This work was begun many years ago. In 1908 I read in the
British Museum many newspapers and journals for the years
1860-1865, and then planned a survey of English public opinion on
the American Civil War. In the succeeding years as a teacher at
Stanford University, California, the published diplomatic
correspondence of Great Britain and of the United States were
studied in connection with instruction given in the field of
British-American relations. Several of my students prepared
excellent theses on special topics and these have been acknowledged
where used in this work. Many distractions and other writing
prevented the completion of my original plan; and fortunately, for
when in 1913 I had at last begun this work and had prepared three
chapters, a letter was received from the late Charles Francis Adams
inviting me to collaborate with him in preparing a "Life" of his
father, the Charles Francis Adams who was American Minister to
Great Britain during the Civil War. Mr. Adams had recently returned
from England where he had given at Oxford University a series of
lectures on the Civil War and had been so fortunate as to obtain
copies, made under the scholarly supervision of Mr. Worthington C.
Ford, of a great mass of correspondence from the Foreign Office
files in the Public Record Office and from the private papers in
the possession of various families.</p>
<p>The first half of the year 1914 was spent with Mr. Adams at
Washington and at South Lincoln, in preparing the "Life." Two
volumes were completed, the first by Mr. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_vi"></a>[V1:pg vi]</span> Adams carrying
the story to 1848, the second by myself for the period 1848 to
1860. For the third volume I analysed and organized the new
materials obtained in England and we were about to begin actual
collaboration on the most vital period of the "Life" when Mr. Adams
died, and the work was indefinitely suspended, probably wisely,
since any completion of the "Life" by me would have lacked that
individual charm in historical writing so markedly characteristic
of all that Mr. Adams did. The half-year spent with Mr. Adams was
an inspiration and constitutes a precious memory.</p>
<p>The Great War interrupted my own historical work, but in 1920 I
returned to the original plan of a work on "Great Britain and the
American Civil War" in the hope that the English materials obtained
by Mr. Adams might be made available to me. When copies were
secured by Mr. Adams in 1913 a restriction had been imposed by the
Foreign Office to the effect that while studied for information,
citations and quotations were not permissible since the general
diplomatic archives were not yet open to students beyond the year
1859. Through my friend Sir Charles Lucas, the whole matter was
again presented to the Foreign Office, with an exact statement that
the new request was in no way related to the proposed "Life" of
Charles Francis Adams, but was for my own use of the materials.
Lord Curzon, then Foreign Secretary, graciously approved the
request but with the usual condition that my manuscript be
submitted before publication to the Foreign Office. This has now
been done, and no single citation censored. Before this work will
have appeared the limitation hitherto imposed on diplomatic
correspondence will have been removed, and the date for open
research have been advanced beyond 1865, the end of the Civil
War.</p>
<p>Similar explanations of my purpose and proposed work were made
through my friend Mr. Francis W. Hirst to the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_vii"></a>[V1:pg vii]</span> owners of
various private papers, and prompt approval given. In 1924 I came
to England for further study of some of these private papers. The
Russell Papers, transmitted to the Public Record Office in 1914 and
there preserved, were used through the courtesy of the Executors of
the late Hon. Rollo Russell, and with the hearty goodwill of Lady
Agatha Russell, daughter of the late Earl Russell, the only living
representative of her father, Mr. Rollo Russell, his son, having
died in 1914. The Lyons Papers, preserved in the Muniment Room at
Old Norfolk House, were used through the courtesy of the Duchess of
Norfolk, who now represents her son who is a minor. The Gladstone
Papers, preserved at Hawarden Castle, were used through the
courtesy of the Gladstone Trustees. The few citations from the
Palmerston Papers, preserved at Broadlands, were approved by
Lieut.-Colonel Wilfred Ashley, M.P.</p>
<p>The opportunity to study these private papers has been
invaluable for my work. Shortly after returning from England in
1913 Mr. Worthington Ford well said: "The inside history of
diplomatic relations between the United States and Great Britain
may be surmised from the official archives; the tinting and shading
needed to complete the picture must be sought elsewhere." (Mass.
Hist. Soc. <i>Proceedings</i>, XLVI, p. 478.) Mr. C.F. Adams
declared (<i>ibid.</i>, XLVII, p. 54) that without these papers
"... the character of English diplomacy at that time (1860-1865)
cannot be understood.... It would appear that the commonly
entertained impressions as to certain phases of international
relations, and the proceedings and utterances of English public men
during the progress of the War of Secession, must be to some extent
revised."</p>
<p>In addition to the new English materials I have been fortunate
in the generosity of my colleague at Stanford University, Professor
Frank A. Golder, who has given to me transcripts, obtained at St.
Petersburg in 1914, of all <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_viii"></a>[V1:pg viii]</span> Russian diplomatic
correspondence on the Civil War. Many friends have aided, by
suggestion or by permitting the use of notes and manuscripts, in
the preparation of this work. I have sought to make due
acknowledgment for such aid in my foot-notes. But in addition to
those already named, I should here particularly note the courtesy
of the late Mr. Gaillard Hunt for facilities given in the State
Department at Washington, of Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of
Congress, for the transcript of the Correspondence of Mason and
Slidell, Confederate Commissioners in Europe, and of Mr. Charles
Moore, Chief of Manuscripts Division, Library of Congress, for the
use of the Schurz Papers containing copies of the despatches of
Schleiden, Minister of the Republic of Bremen at Washington during
the Civil War. Especially thanks are due to my friend, Mr. Herbert
Hoover, for his early interest in this work and for his generous
aid in the making of transcripts which would otherwise have been
beyond my means. And, finally, I owe much to the skill and care of
my wife who made the entire typescript for the Press, and whose
criticisms were invaluable.</p>
<p>It is no purpose of a Preface to indicate results, but it is my
hope that with, I trust, a "calm comparison of the evidence," now
for the first time available to the historian, a fairly true
estimate may be made of what the American Civil War meant to Great
Britain; how she regarded it and how she reacted to it. In brief,
my work is primarily a study in British history in the belief that
the American drama had a world significance, and peculiarly a
British one.</p>

<h1>GREAT BRITAIN<br>
AND THE<br>
AMERICAN CIVIL WAR</h1>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>BACKGROUNDS</h3>
<br>
<p>In 1862, less than a year after he had assumed his post in
London, the American Minister, Charles Francis Adams, at a time of
depression and bitterness wrote to Secretary of State Seward: "That
Great Britain did, in the most terrible moment of our domestic
trial in struggling with a monstrous social evil she had earnestly
professed to abhor, coldly and at once assume our inability to
master it, and then become the only foreign nation steadily
contributing in every indirect way possible to verify its judgment,
will probably be the verdict made against her by posterity, on calm
comparison of the evidence<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1">[1]</a>." Very different were the views of
Englishmen. The historian, George Grote, could write: "The perfect
neutrality [of Great Britain] in this destructive war appears to me
almost a phenomenon in political history. No such forbearance has
been shown during the political history of the last two centuries.
It is the single case in which the English Government and
public--generally so meddlesome--have displayed most prudent and
commendable forbearance in spite of great temptations to the
contrary<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a>." And
Sir William Harcourt, in September, 1863, declared: "Among all Lord
Russell's many titles to fame and to public gratitude, the manner
in which he has steered the vessel of State through the Scylla and
Charybdis of the American War will, I think, always stand
conspicuous<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3">[3]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2"></a>[V1:pg 2]</span>
<p>Minister Adams, in the later years of the Civil War, saw reason
somewhat to modify his earlier judgment, but his indictment of
Great Britain was long prevalent in America, as, indeed, it was
also among the historians and writers of Continental
Europe--notably those of France and Russia. To what extent was this
dictum justified? Did Great Britain in spite of her long years of
championship of personal freedom and of leadership in the cause of
anti-slavery seize upon the opportunity offered in the disruption
of the American Union, and forgetting humanitarian idealisms, react
only to selfish motives of commercial advantage and national power?
In brief, how is the American Civil War to be depicted by
historians of Great Britain, recording her attitude and action in
both foreign and domestic policy, and revealing the principles of
her statesmen, or the inspirations of her people?</p>
<p>It was to answer this question that the present work was
originally undertaken; but as investigation proceeded it became
progressively more clear that the great crisis in America was
almost equally a crisis in the domestic history of Great Britain
itself and that unless this were fully appreciated no just estimate
was possible of British policy toward America. Still more it became
evident that the American Civil War, as seen through British
spectacles, could not be understood if regarded as an isolated and
unique situation, but that the conditions preceding that
situation--some of them lying far back in the relations of the two
nations--had a vital bearing on British policy and opinion when the
crisis arose. No expanded examination of these preceding conditions
is here possible, but it is to a summary analysis of them that this
first chapter is devoted.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>On the American War for separation from the Mother Country it is
unnecessary to dilate, though it should always <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_3"></a>[V1:pg 3]</span> be remembered that
both during the war and afterwards there existed a minority in
Great Britain strongly sympathetic with the political ideals
proclaimed in America--regarding those ideals, indeed, as something
to be striven for in Britain itself and the conflict with America
as, in a measure, a conflict in home politics. But independence
once acknowledged by the Treaty of Peace of 1783, the relations
between the Mother Country and the newly-created United States of
America rapidly tended to adjust themselves to lines of contact
customary between Great Britain and any other Sovereign State. Such
contacts, fixing national attitude and policy, ordinarily occur on
three main lines: governmental, determined by officials in
authority in either State whose duty it is to secure the greatest
advantage in power and prosperity for the State; commercial,
resulting, primarily, from the interchange of goods and the
business opportunities of either nation in the other's territory,
or from their rivalry in foreign trade; idealistic, the result of
comparative development especially in those ideals of political
structure which determine the nature of the State and the form of
its government. The more obvious of these contacts is the
governmental, since the attitude of a people is judged by the
formal action of its Government, and, indeed, in all three lines of
contact the government of a State is directly concerned and
frequently active. But it may be of service to a clearer
appreciation of British attitude and policy before 1860, if the
intermingling of elements required by a strict chronological
account of relations is here replaced by a separate review of each
of the three main lines of contact.</p>
<p>Once independence had been yielded to the American Colonies, the
interest of the British Government rapidly waned in affairs
American. True, there still remained the valued establishments in
the West Indies, and the less considered British possessions on the
continent to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"></a>[V1:pg
4]</span> north of the United States. Meanwhile, there were
occasional frictions with America arising from uncertain claims
drawn from the former colonial privileges of the new state, or from
boundary contentions not settled in the treaty of peace. Thus the
use of the Newfoundland fisheries furnished ground for an
acrimonious controversy lasting even into the twentieth century,
and occasionally rising to the danger point. Boundary disputes
dragged along through official argument, survey commissions,
arbitration, to final settlement, as in the case of the northern
limits of the State of Maine fixed at last by the Treaty of
Washington of 1842, and then on lines fair to both sides at any
time in the forty years of legal bickering. Very early, in 1817, an
agreement creditable to the wisdom and pacific intentions of both
countries, was reached establishing small and equal naval armaments
on the Great Lakes. The British fear of an American attack on
Canada proved groundless as time went on and was definitely set at
rest by the strict curb placed by the American Government upon the
restless activities of such of its citizens as sympathized with the
followers of McKenzie and Papineau in the Canadian rebellion of
1837<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>None of these governmental contacts affected greatly the British
policy toward America. But the "War of 1812," as it is termed in
the United States, "Mr. Madison's War," as it was derisively named
by Tory contemporaries in Great Britain, arose from serious
policies in which the respective governments were in definite
opposition. Briefly, this was a clash between belligerent and
neutral interests. Britain, fighting at first for the preservation
of Europe against the spread of French revolutionary influence,
later against the Napoleonic plan of Empire, held the seas in her
grasp and exercised with vigour all the accustomed rights of a
naval <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"></a>[V1:pg 5]</span>
belligerent. Of necessity, from her point of view, and as always in
the case of the dominant naval belligerent, she stretched
principles of international law to their utmost interpretation to
secure her victory in war. America, soon the only maritime neutral
of importance, and profiting greatly by her neutrality, contested
point by point the issue of exceeded belligerent right as
established in international law. America did more; she advanced
new rules and theories of belligerent and neutral right
respectively, and demanded that the belligerents accede to them.
Dispute arose over blockades, contraband, the British "rule of
1756" which would have forbidden American trade with French
colonies in war time, since such trade was prohibited by France
herself in time of peace. But first and foremost as touching the
personal sensibilities and patriotism of both countries was the
British exercise of a right of search and seizure to recover
British sailors.</p>
<p>Moreover this asserted right brought into clear view definitely
opposed theories as to citizenship. Great Britain claimed that a
man once born a British subject could never cease to be a
subject--could never "alienate his duty." It was her practice to
fill up her navy, in part at least, by the "impressment" of her
sailor folk, taking them whenever needed, and wherever found--in
her own coast towns, or from the decks of her own mercantile
marine. But many British sailors sought security from such
impressment by desertion in American ports or were tempted to
desert to American merchant ships by the high pay obtainable in the
rapidly-expanding United States merchant marine. Many became by
naturalization citizens of the United States, and it was the duty
of America to defend them as such in their lives and business.
America ultimately came to hold, in short, that expatriation was
accomplished from Great Britain when American citizenship was
conferred. On shore they were safe, for Britain did not attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"></a>[V1:pg 6]</span> to
reclaim her subjects from the soil of another nation. But she
denied that the American flag on merchant vessels at sea gave like
security and she asserted a naval right to search such vessels in
time of peace, professing her complete acquiescence in a like right
to the American navy over British merchant vessels--a concession
refused by America, and of no practical value since no American
citizen sought service in the British merchant marine.</p>
<p>This "right of search" controversy involved then, two basic
points of opposition between the two governments. First America
contested the British theory of "once a citizen always a
citizen<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5">[5]</a>";
second, America denied any right whatever to a foreign naval vessel
in <i>time of peace</i> to stop and search a vessel lawfully flying
the American flag. The <i>right of search in time of war</i>, that
is, a belligerent right of search, America never denied, but there
was both then and later much public confusion in both countries as
to the question at issue since, once at war, Great Britain
frequently exercised a legal belligerent right of search and
followed it up by the seizure of sailors alleged to be British
subjects. Nor were British naval captains especially careful to
make sure that no American-born sailors were included in their
impressment seizures, and as the accounts spread of victim after
victim, the American irritation steadily increased. True, France
was also an offender, but as the weaker naval power her offence was
lost sight of in view of the, literally, thousands of <i>bona
fide</i> Americans seized by Great Britain. Here, then, was a third
cause of irritation connected with impressment, though not a point
of governmental dispute as to right, for Great Britain professed
her earnest desire to restore promptly any American-born sailors
whom her naval officers had seized through error. In fact many such
sailors were soon liberated, but a large number either continued to
serve <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"></a>[V1:pg 7]</span>
on British ships or to languish in British prisons until the end of
the Napoleonic Wars<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>There were other, possibly greater, causes of the War of 1812,
most of them arising out of the conflicting interests of the chief
maritime neutral and the chief naval belligerent. The pacific
presidential administration of Jefferson sought by trade
restrictions, using embargo and non-intercourse acts, to bring
pressure on both England and France, hoping to force a better
treatment of neutrals. The United States, divided in sympathy
between the belligerents, came near to disorder and disruption at
home, over the question of foreign policy. But through all American
factions there ran the feeling of growing animosity to Great
Britain because of impressment. At last, war was declared by
America in 1812 and though at the moment bitterly opposed by one
section, New England, that war later came to be regarded as of
great national value as one of the factors which welded the
discordant states into a national unity. Naturally also, the war
once ended, its commercial causes were quickly forgotten, whereas
the individual, personal offence involved in impressment and right
of search, with its insult to national pride, became a patriotic
theme for politicians and for the press. To deny, in fact, a
British "right of search" became a national point of honour, upon
which no American statesman would have dared to yield to British
overtures.</p>
<p>In American eyes the War of 1812 appears as a "second war of
Independence" and also as of international importance in contesting
an unjust use by Britain of her control of the seas. Also, it is to
be remembered that no other war of importance was fought by America
until the Mexican War of 1846, and militant patriotism was thus
centred on the two wars fought against Great Britain. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_8"></a>[V1:pg 8]</span> The contemporary
British view was that of a nation involved in a life and death
struggle with a great European enemy, irritated by what seemed
captious claims, developed to war, by a minor power<a name=
"FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a>. To be sure there
were a few obstinate Tories in Britain who saw in the war the
opportunity of smashing at one blow Napoleon's dream of empire, and
the American "democratic system." The London <i>Times</i> urged the
government to "finish with Mr. Bonaparte and then deal with Mr.
Madison and democracy," arguing that it should be England's object
to subvert "the whole system of the Jeffersonian school." But this
was not the purpose of the British Government, nor would such a
purpose have been tolerated by the small but vigorous Whig minority
in Parliament.</p>
<p>The peace of 1814, signed at Ghent, merely declared an end of
the war, quietly ignoring all the alleged causes of the conflict.
Impressment was not mentioned, but it was never again resorted to
by Great Britain upon American ships. But the principle of right of
search in time of peace, though for another object than
impressment, was soon again asserted by Great Britain and for forty
years was a cause of constant irritation and a source of danger in
the relations of the two countries. Stirred by philanthropic
emotion Great Britain entered upon a world crusade for the
suppression of the African Slave Trade. All nations in principle
repudiated that trade and Britain made treaties with various
maritime powers giving mutual right of search to the naval vessels
of each upon the others' merchant vessels. The African Slave Trade
was in fact outlawed for the flags of all nations. But America,
smarting under the memory of impressment injuries, and maintaining
in any case the doctrine that in time of peace the national flag
protected a vessel from interference <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_9"></a>[V1:pg 9]</span> or search by the naval vessels of any
other power, refused to sign mutual right of search treaties and
denied, absolutely, such a right for any cause whatever to Great
Britain or to any other nation. Being refused a treaty, Britain
merely renewed her assertion of the right and continued to exercise
it.</p>
<p>Thus the right of search in time of peace controversy was not
ended with the war of 1812 but remained a constant sore in national
relations, for Britain alone used her navy with energy to suppress
the slave trade, and the slave traders of all nations sought
refuge, when approached by a British naval vessel, under the
protection of the American flag. If Britain respected the flag, and
sheered off from search, how could she stop the trade? If she
ignored the flag and on boarding found an innocent American vessel
engaged in legal trade, there resulted claims for damages by
detention of voyage, and demands by the American Government for
apology and reparation. The real slave trader, seized under the
American flag, never protested to the United States, nor claimed
American citizenship, for his punishment in American law for
engaging in the slave trade was death, while under the law of any
other nation it did not exceed imprisonment, fine and loss of his
vessel.</p>
<p>Summed up in terms of governmental attitude the British
contention was that here was a great international humanitarian
object frustrated by an absurd American sensitiveness on a point of
honour about the flag. After fifteen years of dispute Great Britain
offered to abandon any claim to a right of <i>search</i>,
contenting herself with a right of <i>visit</i>, merely to verify a
vessel's right to fly the American flag. America asserted this to
be mere pretence, involving no renunciation of a practice whose
legality she denied. In 1842, in the treaty settling the Maine
boundary controversy, the eighth article sought a method of escape.
Joint cruising squadrons were provided for the coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"></a>[V1:pg 10]</span>
Africa, the British to search all suspected vessels except those
flying the American flag, and these to be searched by the American
squadron. At once President Tyler notified Congress that Great
Britain had renounced the right of search. Immediately in
Parliament a clamour was raised against the Government for the
"sacrifice" of a British right at sea, and Lord Aberdeen promptly
made official disclaimer of such surrender.</p>
<p>Thus, heritage of the War of 1812 right of search in time of
peace was a steady irritant. America doubted somewhat the honesty
of Great Britain, appreciating in part the humanitarian purpose,
but suspicious of an ulterior "will to rule the seas." After 1830
no American political leader would have dared to yield the right of
search. Great Britain for her part, viewing the expansion of
domestic slavery in the United States, came gradually to attribute
the American contention, not to patriotic pride, but to the selfish
business interests of the slave-holding states. In the end, in
1858, with a waning British enthusiasm for the cause of slave trade
suppression, and with recognition that America had become a great
world power, Britain yielded her claim to right of search or visit,
save when established by Treaty. Four years later, in 1862, it may
well have seemed to British statesmen that American slavery had
indeed been the basic cause of America's attitude, for in that year
a treaty was signed by the two nations giving mutual right of
search for the suppression of the African Slave Trade. In fact,
however, this was but an effort by Seward, Secretary of State for
the North, to influence British and European opinion against the
seceding slave states of the South.</p>
<p>The right of search controversy was, in truth, ended when
American power reached a point where the British Government must
take it seriously into account as a factor in general world policy.
That power had been steadily and rapidly advancing since 1814. From
almost the first moment <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_11"></a>[V1:pg 11]</span> of established independence
American statesmen visualized the separation of the interests of
the western continent from those of Europe, and planned for
American leadership in this new world. Washington, the first
President, emphasized in his farewell address the danger of
entangling alliances with Europe. For long the nations of Europe,
immersed in Continental wars, put aside their rivalries in this new
world. Britain, for a time, neglected colonial expansion westward,
but in 1823, in an emergency of European origin when France,
commissioned by the great powers of continental Europe, intervened
in Spain to restore the deposed Bourbon monarchy and seemed about
to intervene in Spanish America to restore to Spain her revolted
colonies, there developed in Great Britain a policy, seemingly
about to draw America and England into closer co-operation.
Canning, for Britain, proposed to America a joint declaration
against French intervention in the Americas. His argument was
against the principle of intervention; his immediate motive was a
fear of French colonial expansion; but his ultimate object was
inheritance by Britain of Spain's dying influence and position in
the new world.</p>
<p>Canning's overture was earnestly considered in America. The
ex-Presidents, Jefferson and Madison, recommended its acceptance,
but the Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, opposed this,
favouring rather a separate declaration by the United States, and
of this opinion was also President Monroe. Thus arose the Monroe
Doctrine announcing American opposition to the principle of
"intervention," and declaring that the American continents were no
longer to be regarded as open to further colonization by European
nations. The British emergency situation with France, though
already quieted, caused Monroe's Message to be greeted in England
with high approval. But Canning did not so approve it for he saw
clearly that the Monroe Doctrine was a challenge <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_12"></a>[V1:pg 12]</span> not merely to
continental Europe, but to England as well and he set himself to
thwart this threatening American policy. Had Canning's policy been
followed by later British statesmen there would have resulted a
serious clash with the United States<a name=
"FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>In fact the Monroe Doctrine, imposing on Europe a self-denying
policy of non-colonial expansion toward the west, provided for the
United States the medium, if she wished to use it, for her own
expansion in territory and in influence. But for a time there was
no need of additional territory for that already hers stretched
from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, two-thirds of the way
from ocean to ocean. Her population was growing fast. But four
millions at the time of the Revolution, there were thirteen
millions in 1830, and of these nearly a third were already across
the Appalachian range and were constantly pressing on towards new
lands in the South and West. The Monroe Doctrine was the first
definite notice given to Europe of America's preconceived
"destiny," but the earlier realization of that destiny took place
on lines of expansion within her own boundaries. To this there
could be no governmental objection, whether by Great Britain or any
other nation.</p>
<p>But when in the decade 1840 to 1850, the United States, to the
view of British statesmen, suddenly startled the world by entering
upon a policy of further territorial expansion, forsaking her
peaceful progress and turning toward war, there was a quick
determination on a line of British policy as regards the American
advance. The first intimation of the new American policy came in
relation to the State of Texas which had revolted from Mexico in
1836, and whose independence had been generally recognized by 1842.
To this new state Britain sent diplomatic and consular agents and
these reported two factions among the people--one <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_13"></a>[V1:pg 13]</span> seeking admission
to the American Union, one desiring the maintenance of
independence.</p>
<p>In 1841 Aberdeen had sent Lord Ashburton to America with
instructions to secure, if possible, a settlement of all matters in
dispute. Here was a genuine British effort to escape from national
irritations. But before the Treaty of 1842 was signed, even while
it was in the earlier stages of negotiation, the British Government
saw, with alarm, quite new questions arising, preventing, to its
view, that harmonious relation with the United States the desire
for which had led to the Ashburton mission. This new development
was the appearance of an American fever for territorial expansion,
turning first toward Texas, but soon voiced as a "manifest destiny"
which should carry American power and institutions to the Pacific
and even into Central America. Among these institutions was that of
slavery, detested by the public of Great Britain, yet a delicate
matter for governmental consideration since the great cotton
manufacturing interests drew the bulk of their supplies of raw
cotton from the slave-holding states of America. If Texas, herself
a cotton state, should join the United States, dependence upon
slave-grown cotton would be intensified. Also, Texas, once
acquired, what was there to prevent further American exploitation,
followed by slave expansion, into Mexico, where for long British
influence had been dominant?</p>
<p>On the fate of Texas, therefore, centred for a time the whole
British policy toward America. Pakenham, the British minister to
Mexico, urged a British pressure on Mexico to forgo her plans of
reconquering Texas, and strong British efforts to encourage Texas
in maintaining her independence. His theory foreshadowed a powerful
buffer Anglo-Saxon state, prohibiting American advance to the
south-west, releasing Britain from dependence on American cotton,
and ultimately, he hoped, leading Texas to abolish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_14"></a>[V1:pg 14]</span> slavery, not yet
so rooted as to be ineradicable. This policy was approved by the
British Government, Pakenham was sent to Washington to watch
events, a <i>charg&eacute;</i>, Elliot, was despatched to Texas,
and from London lines were cast to draw France into the plan and to
force the acquiescence of Mexico.</p>
<p>In this brief account of main lines of governmental contacts, it
is unnecessary to recite the details of the diplomatic conflict,
for such it became, with sharp antagonisms manifested on both
sides. The basic fact was that America was bent upon territorial
expansion, and that Great Britain set herself to thwart this
ambition. But not to the point of war. Aberdeen was so incautious
at one moment as to propose to France and Mexico a triple guarantee
of the independence of Texas, if that state would acquiesce, but
when Pakenham notified him that in this case, Britain must clearly
understand that war with America was not merely possible, but
probable, Aberdeen hastened to withdraw the plan of guarantee,
fortunately not yet approved by Mexico<a name=
"FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>The solution of this diplomatic contest thus rested with Texas.
Did she wish annexation to the United States, or did she prefer
independence? Elliot, in Texas, hoped to the last moment that Texas
would choose independence and British favour. But the people of the
new state were largely emigrants from the United States, and a
majority of them wished to re-enter the Union, a step finally
accomplished in 1846, after ten years of separate existence as a
Republic. The part played by the British Government in this whole
episode was not a fortunate one. It is the duty of Governments to
watch over the interests of their subjects, and to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_15"></a>[V1:pg 15]</span> guard the
prestige and power of the state. Great Britain had a perfect
<i>right</i> to take whatever steps she chose to take in regard to
Texas, but the steps taken appeared to Americans to be based upon a
policy antagonistic to the American expansion policy of the moment.
The Government of Great Britain appeared, indeed, to have adopted a
policy of preventing the development of the power of the United
States. Then, fronted with war, she had meekly withdrawn. The basic
British public feeling, fixing the limits of governmental policy,
of never again being drawn into war with America, not because of
fear, but because of important trade relations and also because of
essential liking and admiration, in spite of surface antagonisms,
was not appreciated in America. Lord Aberdeen indeed, and others in
governmental circles, pleaded that the support of Texan
independence was in reality perfectly in harmony with the best
interests of the United States, since it would have tended toward
the limitation of American slavery. And in the matter of national
power, they consoled themselves with prophecies that the American
Union, now so swollen in size, must inevitably split into two,
perhaps three, rival empires, a slave-holding one in the South,
free nations in North and West.</p>
<p>The fate of Texas sealed, Britain soon definitely abandoned all
opposition to American expansion unless it were to be attempted
northwards, though prophesying evil for the American madness.
Mexico, relying on past favours, and because of a sharp controversy
between the United States and Great Britain over the Oregon
territory, expected British aid in her war of 1846 against America.
But she was sharply warned that such aid would not be given, and
the Oregon dispute was settled in the Anglo-Saxon fashion of
vigorous legal argument, followed by a fair compromise. The Mexican
war resulted in the acquisition of California by the United States.
British agents in this province of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_16"></a>[V1:pg 16]</span> Mexico, and British admirals on the
Pacific were cautioned to take no active steps in opposition.</p>
<p>Thus British policy, after Texan annexation, offered no barrier
to American expansion, and much to British relief the fear of the
extension of the American plans to Mexico and Central America was
not realized. The United States was soon plunged, as British
statesmen had prophesied, into internal conflict over the question
whether the newly-acquired territories should be slave or free.</p>
<p>The acquisition of California brought up a new problem of quick
transit between Atlantic and Pacific, and a canal was planned
across Central America. Here Britain and America acted together, at
first in amity, though the convention signed in 1850 later
developed discord as to the British claim of a protectorate over
the Atlantic end of the proposed canal at San Juan del Nicaragua.
But Britain was again at war in Europe in the middle 'fifties, and
America was deep in quarrel over slavery at home. On both sides in
spite of much diplomatic intrigue and of manifestations of national
pride there was governmental desire to avoid difficulties. At the
end of the ten-year period Britain ceded to Nicaragua her
protectorate in the canal zone, and all causes of friction, so
reported President Buchanan to Congress in 1860, were happily
removed. Britain definitely altered her policy of opposition to the
growth of American power.</p>
<p>In 1860, then, the causes of governmental antagonisms were
seemingly all at an end. Impressment was not used after 1814. The
differing theories of the two Governments on British expatriation
still remained, but Britain attempted no practical application of
her view. The right of search in time of peace controversy, first
eased by the plan of joint cruising, had been definitely settled by
the British renunciation of 1858. Opposition to American
territorial advance but briefly manifested by Britain, had ended
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"></a>[V1:pg 17]</span>
the annexation of Texas, and the fever of expansion had waned in
America. Minor disputes in Central America, related to the proposed
canal, were amicably adjusted.</p>
<p>But differences between nations, varying view-points of peoples,
frequently have deeper currents than the more obvious frictions in
governmental act or policy, nor can governments themselves fail to
react to such less evident causes. It is necessary to review the
commercial relations of the two nations--later to examine their
political ideals.</p>
<p>In 1783 America won her independence in government from a
colonial status. But commercially she remained a British
colony--yet with a difference. She had formed a part of the British
colonial system. All her normal trade was with the mother country
or with other British colonies. Now her privileges in such trade
were at an end, and she must seek as a favour that which had
formerly been hers as a member of the British Empire. The direct
trade between England and America was easily and quickly resumed,
for the commercial classes of both nations desired it and profited
by it. But the British colonial system prohibited trade between a
foreign state and British colonies and there was one channel of
trade, to and from the British West Indies, long very profitable to
both sides, during colonial times, but now legally hampered by
American independence. The New England States had lumber, fish, and
farm products desired by the West Indian planters, and these in
turn offered needed sugar, molasses, and rum. Both parties desired
to restore the trade, and in spite of the legal restrictions of the
colonial system, the trade was in fact resumed in part and either
permitted or winked at by the British Government, but never to the
advantageous exchange of former times.</p>
<p>The acute stage of controversy over West Indian trade was not
reached until some thirty years after American Independence, but
the uncertainty of such trade during a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_18"></a>[V1:pg 18]</span> long period in
which a portion of it consisted in unauthorized and unregulated
exchange was a constant irritant to all parties concerned.
Meanwhile there came the War of 1812 with its preliminary check
upon direct trade to and from Great Britain, and its final total
prohibition of intercourse during the war itself. In 1800 the bulk
of American importation of manufactures still came from Great
Britain. In the contest over neutral rights and theories, Jefferson
attempted to bring pressure on the belligerents, and especially on
England, by restriction of imports. First came a non-importation
Act, 1806, followed by an embargo on exports, 1807, but these were
so unpopular in the commercial states of New England that they were
withdrawn in 1810, yet for a short time only, for Napoleon tricked
the United States into believing that France had yielded to
American contentions on neutral rights, and in 1811 non-intercourse
was proclaimed again with England alone. On June 18, 1812, America
finally declared war and trade stopped save in a few New England
ports where rebellious citizens continued to sell provisions to a
blockading British naval squadron.</p>
<p>For eight years after 1806, then, trade with Great Britain had
steadily decreased, finally almost to extinction during the war.
But America required certain articles customarily imported and
necessity now forced her to develop her own manufactures. New
England had been the centre of American foreign commerce, but now
there began a trend toward manufacturing enterprise. Even in 1814,
however, at the end of the war, it was still thought in the United
States that under normal conditions manufactured goods would again
be imported and the general cry of "protection for home industries"
was as yet unvoiced. Nevertheless, a group of infant industries had
in fact been started and clamoured for defence now that peace was
restored. This situation was not unnoticed in Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"></a>[V1:pg 19]</span> where
merchants, piling up goods in anticipation of peace on the
continent of Europe and a restored market, suddenly discovered that
the poverty of Europe denied them that market. Looking with
apprehension toward the new industries of America, British
merchants, following the advice of Lord Brougham in a parliamentary
speech, dumped great quantities of their surplus goods on the
American market, selling them far below cost, or even on
extravagant credit terms. One object was to smash the budding
American manufactures.</p>
<p>This action of British merchants naturally stirred some angry
patriotic emotions in the circles where American business suffered
and a demand began to be heard for protection. But the Government
of the United States was still representative of agriculture, in
the main, and while a Tariff Bill was enacted in 1816 that Bill was
regarded as a temporary measure required by the necessity of paying
the costs of the recent war. Just at this juncture, however,
British policy, now looking again toward a great colonial empire,
sought advantages for the hitherto neglected maritime provinces of
British North America, and thought that it had found them by
encouragement of their trade with the British West Indies. The
legal status of American trade with the West Indies was now
enforced and for a time intercourse was practically suspended.</p>
<p>This British policy brought to the front the issue of protection
in America. It not only worked against a return by New England from
manufacturing to commerce, but it soon brought into the ranks of
protectionists a northern and western agricultural element that had
been accustomed to sell surplus products to West Indian planters
seeking cheap food-stuffs for their slaves. This new protectionist
element was as yet not crystallized into a clamour for "home
markets" for agriculture, but the pressure of opinion was beginning
to be felt, and by 1820 the question <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_20"></a>[V1:pg 20]</span> of West Indian trade became one of
constant agitation and demanded political action. That action was
taken on lines of retaliation. Congress in 1818 passed a law
excluding from American ports any British vessel coming from a port
access to which was denied to an American vessel, and placing under
bond in American ports British vessels with prohibition of their
proceeding to a British port to which American vessels could not
go. This act affected not merely direct trade with the West Indies,
but stopped the general custom of British ships of taking part
cargoes to Jamaica while <i>en route</i> to and from the United
States. The result was, first, compromise, later, under Huskisson's
administration at the British Board of Trade, complete abandonment
by Britain of the exclusive trade basis of her whole colonial
system.</p>
<p>The "retaliatory system" which J.Q. Adams regarded as "a new
declaration of independence," was, in fact, quickly taken up by
other non-colonial nations, and these, with America, compelled
Great Britain to take stock of her interests. Huskisson, rightly
foreseeing British prosperity as dependent upon her manufactures
and upon the carrying trade, stated in Parliament that American
"retaliation" had forced the issue. Freedom of trade in British
ports was offered in 1826 to all non-colonial nations that would
open their ports within one year on terms of equality to British
ships. J.Q. Adams, now President of the United States, delayed
acceptance of this offer, preferring a treaty negotiation, and was
rebuffed by Canning, so that actual resumption of West Indian trade
did not take place until 1830, after the close of Adams'
administration. That trade never recovered its former
prosperity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the long period of controversy, from 1806 to 1830, had
resulted in a complete change in the American situation. It is not
a sufficient explanation of the American belief in, and practice
of, the theory of protection to attribute <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_21"></a>[V1:pg 21]</span> this alone to
British checks placed upon free commercial rivalry. Nevertheless
the progress of America toward an established system, reaching its
highest mark for years in the Tariff Bill of 1828, is distinctly
related to the events just narrated. After American independence,
the partially illegal status of West Indian trade hampered
commercial progress and slightly encouraged American manufactures
by the mere seeking of capital for investment; the neutral troubles
of 1806 and the American prohibitions on intercourse increased the
transfer of interest; the war of 1812 gave a complete protection to
infant industries; the dumping of British goods in 1815 stirred
patriotic American feeling; British renewal of colonial system
restrictions, and the twelve-year quarrel over "retaliation" gave
time for the definite establishment of protectionist ideas in the
United States. But Britain was soon proclaiming for herself and for
the world the common advantage and the justice of a great theory of
free trade. America was apparently now committed to an opposing
economic theory, the first great nation definitely to establish it,
and thus there resulted a clear-cut opposition of principle and a
clash of interests. From 1846, when free trade ideas triumphed in
England, the devoted British free trader regarded America as the
chief obstacle to a world-wide acceptance of his theory.</p>
<p>The one bright spot in America, as regarded by the British free
trader, was in the Southern States, where cotton interests,
desiring no advantage from protection, since their market was in
Europe, attacked American protection and sought to escape from it.
Also slave supplies, without protection, could have been purchased
more cheaply from England than from the manufacturing North. In
1833 indeed the South had forced a reaction against protection, but
it proceeded slowly. In 1854 it was Southern opinion that carried
through Congress the reciprocity treaty with the British American
Provinces, partly brought about, no <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_22"></a>[V1:pg 22]</span> doubt, by a Southern fear that
Canada, bitter over the loss of special advantages in British
markets by the British free trade of 1846, might join the United
States and thus swell the Northern and free states of the Union.
Cotton interests and trade became the dominant British commercial
tie with the United States, and the one great hope, to the British
minds, of a break in the false American system of protection. Thus
both in economic theory and in trade, spite of British dislike of
slavery, the export trading interests of Great Britain became more
and more directed toward the Southern States of America. Adding
powerfully to this was the dependence of British cotton
manufactures upon the American supply. The British trade attitude,
arising largely outside of direct governmental contacts, was bound
to have, nevertheless, a constant and important influence on
governmental action.</p>
<p>Governmental policy, seeking national power, conflicting trade
and industrial interests, are the favourite themes of those
historians who regard nations as determined in their relations
solely by economic causes--by what is called "enlightened
self-interest." But governments, no matter how arbitrary, and still
more if in a measure resting on representation, react both
consciously and unconsciously to a public opinion not obviously
based upon either national or commercial rivalry. Sometimes,
indeed, governmental attitude runs absolutely counter to popular
attitude in international affairs. In such a case, the historical
estimate, if based solely on evidences of governmental action, is a
false one and may do great injustice to the essential friendliness
of a people.</p>
<p>How then, did the British people, of all classes, regard America
before 1860, and in what manner did that regard affect the British
Government? Here, it is necessary to seek British opinion on, and
its reaction to, American institutions, ideals, and practices. Such
public opinion can <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_23"></a>[V1:pg 23]</span> be found in quantity sufficient to
base an estimate only in travellers' books, in reviews, and in
newspapers of the period. When all these are brought together it is
found that while there was an almost universal British criticism of
American social customs and habits of life, due to that insularity
of mental attitude characteristic of every nation, making it prefer
its own customs and criticize those of its neighbours, summed up in
the phrase "dislike of foreigners"--it is found that British
opinion was centred upon two main threads; first America as a place
for emigration and, second, American political ideals and
institutions<a name="FNanchor10"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_10">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>British emigration to America, a governmentally favoured
colonization process before the American revolution, lost that
favour after 1783, though not at first definitely opposed. But
emigration still continued and at no time, save during the war of
1812, was it absolutely stopped. Its exact amount is
unascertainable, for neither Government kept adequate statistics
before 1820. With the end of the Napoleonic wars there came great
distress in England from which the man of energy sought escape. He
turned naturally to America, being familiar, by hearsay at least,
with stories of the ease of gaining a livelihood there, and
influenced by the knowledge that in the United States he would find
people of his own blood and speech. The bulk of this earlier
emigration to America resulted from economic causes. When, in 1825,
one energetic Member of Parliament, Wilmot Horton, induced the
Government to appoint a committee to investigate the whole subject,
the result was a mass of testimony, secured from returned emigrants
or from their letters home, in which there constantly appeared one
main argument influencing the labourer type of emigrant; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"></a>[V1:pg 24]</span> got
good wages, and he was supplied, as a farm hand, with good food.
Repeatedly he testifies that he had "three meat meals a day,"
whereas in England he had ordinarily received but one such meal a
week.</p>
<p>Mere good living was the chief inducement for the labourer type
of emigrant, and the knowledge of such living created for this type
remaining in England a sort of halo of industrial prosperity
surrounding America. But there was a second testimony brought out
by Horton's Committee, less general, yet to be picked up here and
there as evidence of another argument for emigration to America.
The labourer did not dilate upon political equality, nor boast of a
share in government, indeed generally had no such share, but he did
boast to his fellows at home of the social equality, though not
thus expressing it, which was all about him. He was a common farm
hand, yet he "sat down to meals" with his employer and family, and
worked in the fields side by side with his "master." This, too, was
an astounding difference to the mind of the British labourer.
Probably for him it created a clearer, if not altogether universal
and true picture of the meaning of American democracy than would
have volumes of writing upon political institutions. Gradually
there was established in the lower orders of British society a
visualization of America as a haven of physical well-being and
personal social happiness.</p>
<p>This British labouring class had for long, however, no medium of
expression in print. Here existed, then, an unexpressed public
opinion of America, of much latent influence, but for the moment
largely negligible as affecting other classes or the Government. A
more important emigrating class in its influence on opinion at
home, though not a large class, was composed about equally of small
farmers and small merchants facing ruin in the agricultural and
trading crises that followed the end of the European war. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"></a>[V1:pg 25]</span>
British travellers' books from 1810 to 1820 are generally written
by men of this class, or by agents sent out from co-operative
groups planning emigration. Generally they were discontented with
political conditions at home, commonly opposed to a petrified
social order, and attracted to the United States by its lure of
prosperity and content. The books are, in brief, a superior type of
emigrant guide for a superior type of emigrant, examining and
emphasizing industrial opportunity.</p>
<p>Almost universally, however, they sound the note of superior
political institutions and conditions. One wrote "A republican
finds here A Republic, and the only Republic on the face of the
earth that ever deserved the name: where all are under the
protection of equal laws; of laws made by Themselves<a name=
"FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a>." Another, who
established an English colony in the Western States of Illinois,
wrote of England that he objected to "being ruled and taxed by
people who had no more right to rule and tax us than consisted in
the power to do it." And of his adopted country he concludes: "I
love the Government; and thus a novel sensation is excited; it is
like the development of a new faculty. I am become a patriot in my
old age<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a>."
Still another detailed the points of his content, "I am here, lord
and master of myself and of 100 acres of land--an improvable farm,
little trouble to me, good society and a good market, and, I think,
a fine climate, only a little too hot and dry in summer; the parson
gets nothing from me; my state and road taxes and poor rates amount
to &sect;25.00 per annum. I can carry a gun if I choose; I leave my
door unlocked at night; and I can get snuff for one cent an ounce
or a little more<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13">[13]</a>."</p>
<p>From the first days of the American colonial movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26"></a>[V1:pg 26]</span>
toward independence there had been, indeed, a British interest in
American political principles. Many Whigs sympathized with these
principles for reasons of home political controversy. Their
sympathy continued after American independence and by its insistent
expression brought out equally insistent opposition from Tory
circles. The British home movement toward a more representative
Government had been temporarily checked by the extremes into which
French Liberalism plunged in 1791, causing reaction in England. By
1820 pressure was again being exerted by British Liberals of
intelligence, and they found arguments in such reports as those
just quoted. From that date onward, and especially just before the
passing of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet always a factor, the
example of a prosperous American democracy was an element in
British home politics, lauded or derided as the man in England
desired or not an expansion of the British franchise. In the
earlier period, however, it is to be remembered that applause of
American institutions did not mean acceptance of democracy to the
extent of manhood franchise, for no such franchise at first existed
in America itself. The debate in England was simply whether the
step forward in American democracy, was an argument for a similar
step in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Books, reviews and newspapers in Great Britain as the political
quarrel there grew in force, depicted America favourably or
otherwise according to political sympathies at home. Both before
and after the Reform Bill of 1832 this type of effort to mould
opinion, by citation of America, was widespread. Hence there is in
such writing, not so much the expression of public opinion, as of
propaganda to affect that opinion. Book upon book, review upon
review, might be quoted to illustrate this, but a few notable
examples will suffice.</p>
<p>The most widely read and reviewed book on the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"></a>[V1:pg 27]</span>
States before 1840, except the humorous and flippant
characterization of America by Mrs. Trollope, was Captain Basil
Hall's three-volume work, published in 1829<a name=
"FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14">[14]</a>. Claiming an open
mind, he expected for his adverse findings a readier credence. For
adverse to American political institutions these findings are in
all their larger applications. In every line Hall betrays himself
as an old Tory of the 'twenties, fixed in his belief, and convinced
of the perfection and unalterableness of the British Constitution.
Captain Hamilton, who wrote in 1833, was more frank in avowal of a
purpose<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15">[15]</a>. He
states in his preface:</p>
<blockquote>"... When I found the institutions and experiences of
the United States deliberately quoted in the reformed parliament,
as affording safe precedent for British legislation, and learned
that the drivellers who uttered such nonsense, instead of
encountering merited derision, were listened to with patience and
approbation by men as ignorant as themselves, I certainly did feel
that another work on America was yet wanted, and at once determined
to undertake a task which inferior considerations would probably
have induced me to decline."</blockquote>
<p>Harriet Martineau, ardent advocate of political reform at home,
found in the United States proofs for her faith in
democracy<a name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16">[16]</a>.
Captain Marryat belittled Miss Martineau, but in his six volumes
proved himself less a critic of America than an enemy of democracy.
Answering a review of his earlier volumes, published separately, he
wrote in his concluding volume: "I candidly acknowledge that the
reviewer is right in his supposition; my great object has been to
do serious injury to the cause of democracy<a name=
"FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17">[17]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"></a>[V1:pg 28]</span>
<p>The fact was that British governing and intellectual classes
were suffering a recoil from the enthusiasms leading up to the step
toward democracy in the Reform of 1832. The electoral franchise was
still limited to a small minority of the population. Britain was
still ruled by her "wise men" of wealth and position. Meanwhile,
however, just at the moment when dominant Whig influence in England
carried through that step forward toward democratic institutions
which Whigs had long lauded in America, the latter country had
progressed to manhood suffrage, or as nearly all leading
Englishmen, whether Whig or Tory, regarded it, had plunged into the
rule of the mob. The result was a rapid lessening in Whig
ruling-class expression of admiration for America, even before long
to the complete cessation of such admiration, and to assertions in
Great Britain that the Reform of 1832 was "final," the last step
toward democracy which Britain could safely take. It is not strange
that the books and reviews of the period from 1830 to 1840, heavily
stress the dangers and crudity of American democracy. They were
written for what was now a nearly unanimous British reading public,
fearful lest Radical pressure for still further electoral reform
should preach the example of the United States.</p>
<p>Thus after 1832 the previous sympathy for America of one section
of the British governing class disappears. More--it is replaced by
a critical, if not openly hostile attitude. Soon, with the rapid
development of the power and wealth of the United States,
governing-class England, of all factions save the Radical, came to
view America just as it would have viewed any other rising nation,
that is, as a problem to be studied for its influence on British
prosperity and power. Again, expressions in print reflect the
changes of British view--nowhere more clearly than in travellers'
books. After 1840, for nearly a decade, these are devoted, not to
American political institutions, but to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_29"></a>[V1:pg 29]</span> studies, many of
them very careful ones, of American industry and governmental
policy.</p>
<p>Buckingham, one-time member of Parliament, wrote nine volumes of
such description. His work is a storehouse of fact, useful to this
day to the American historical student<a name=
"FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18">[18]</a>. George Combe,
philosopher and phrenologist, studied especially social
institutions<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19">[19]</a>. Joseph Sturge, philanthropist and
abolitionist, made a tour, under the guidance of the poet Whittier,
through the Northern and Eastern States<a name=
"FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20">[20]</a>. Featherstonaugh,
a scientist and civil engineer, described the Southern slave
states, in terms completely at variance with those of
Sturge<a name="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21">[21]</a>.
Kennedy, traveller in Texas, and later British consul at Galveston,
and Warburton, a traveller who came to the United States by way of
Canada, an unusual approach, were both frankly startled, the latter
professedly alarmed, at the evidences of power in America<a name=
"FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22">[22]</a>. Amazed at the
energy, growth and prosperity of the country and alarmed at the
anti-British feeling he found in New York City, Warburton wrote
that "they [Americans] only wait for matured power to apply the
incendiary torch of Republicanism to the nations of Europe<a name=
"FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23">[23]</a>." Soon after this
was written there began, in 1848, that great tide of Irish
emigration to America which heavily reinforced the anti-British
attitude of the City of New York, and largely changed its
character.</p>
<p>Did books dilating upon the expanding power of America reflect
British public opinion, or did they create it? It is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_30"></a>[V1:pg 30]</span> difficult to
estimate such matters. Certainly it is not uninteresting that these
books coincided in point of time with a British governmental
attitude of opposition, though on peaceful lines, to the
development of American power, and to the adoption to the point of
faith, by British commercial classes, of free trade as opposed to
the American protective system. But governing classes were not the
British public, and to the great unenfranchised mass, finding voice
through the writings of a few leaders, the prosperity of America
made a powerful appeal. Radical democracy was again beginning to
make its plea in Britain. In 1849 there was published a study of
the United States, more careful and exact than any previous to
Bryce's great work, and lauding American political institutions.
This was Mackay's "Western World," and that there was a public
eager for such estimate is evidenced by the fact that the book went
through four British editions in 1850<a name=
"FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24">[24]</a>. At the end of the
decade, then, there appeared once more a vigorous champion of the
cause of British democracy, comparing the results of "government by
the wise" with alleged mob rule. Mackay wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Society in America started from the point to which
society in Europe is only yet finding. The equality of men is, to
this moment, its corner-stone ... that which develops itself as the
sympathy of class, becomes in America the general sentiment of
society.... We present an imposing front to the world; but let us
tear the picture and look at the canvas. One out of every seven of
us is a pauper. Every six Englishmen have, in addition to their
other enormous burdens, to support a seventh between them, whose
life is spent in consuming, but in adding nothing to the source of
their common subsistence."</blockquote>
<p>British governing classes then, forgoing after 1850 opposition
to the advance of American power, found themselves <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_31"></a>[V1:pg 31]</span> involved again,
as before 1832, in the problem of the possible influence of a
prosperous American democracy upon an unenfranchised public opinion
at home. Also, for all Englishmen, of whatever class, in spite of
rivalry in power, of opposing theories of trade, of divergent
political institutions, there existed a vague, though influential,
pride in the advance of a people of similar race, sprung from
British loins<a name="FNanchor25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25">[25]</a>. And there remained for all Englishmen also
one puzzling and discreditable American institution, slavery--held
up to scorn by the critics of the United States, difficult of
excuse among her friends.</p>
<p>Agitation conducted by the great philanthropist, Wilberforce,
had early committed British Government and people to a crusade
against the African slave trade. This British policy was clearly
announced to the world in the negotiations at Vienna in 1814-15.
But Britain herself still supported the institution of slavery in
her West Indian colonies and it was not until British humanitarian
sentiment had forced emancipation upon the unwilling sugar
planters, in 1833, that the nation was morally free to criticize
American domestic slavery. Meanwhile great emancipation societies,
with many branches, all virile and active, had grown up in England
and in Scotland. These now turned to an attack on slavery the world
over, and especially on American slavery. The great American
abolitionist, Garrison, found more support in England than in his
own country; his weekly paper, <i>The Liberator</i>, is full of
messages of cheer from British friends and societies, and of
quotations from a sympathetic, though generally provincial, British
press.</p>
<p>From 1830 to 1850 British anti-slavery sentiment was at its
height. It watched with anxiety the evidence of a developing
struggle over slavery in the United States, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_32"></a>[V1:pg 32]</span> hopeful, as each
crisis arose, that the free Northern States would impose their will
upon the Southern Slave States. But as each crisis turned to
compromise, seemingly enhancing the power of the South, and
committing America to a retention of slavery, the hopes of British
abolitionists waned. The North did indeed, to British opinion,
become identified with opposition to the expansion of slavery, but
after the "great compromise of 1850," where the elder American
statesmen of both North and South proclaimed the "finality" of that
measure, British sympathy for the North rapidly lessened. Moreover,
after 1850, there was in Britain itself a decay of general
humanitarian sentiment as regards slavery. The crusade had begun to
seem hopeless and the earlier vigorous agitators were dead. The
British Government still maintained its naval squadron for the
suppression of the African slave trade, but the British official
mind no longer keenly interested itself either in this effort or in
the general question of slavery.</p>
<p>Nevertheless American slavery and slave conditions were still,
after 1850, favourite matters for discussion, almost universally
critical, by English writers. Each renewal of the conflict in
America, even though local, not national in character, drew out a
flood of comment. In the public press this blot upon American
civilization was a steady subject for attack, and that attack was
naturally directed against the South. The London <i>Times</i>, in
particular, lost no opportunity of presenting the matter to its
readers. In 1856, a Mr. Thomas Gladstone visited Kansas during the
height of the border struggles there, and reported his observations
in letters to the <i>Times</i>. The writer was wholly on the side
of the Northern settlers in Kansas, though not hopeful that the
Kansas struggle would expand to a national conflict. He constantly
depicted the superior civilization, industry, and social excellence
of the North as compared with the South<a name=
"FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26">[26]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"></a>[V1:pg 33]</span>
<p>Mrs. Stowe's <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> excited greater interest
in England than in America itself. The first London edition
appeared in May, 1852, and by the end of the year over one million
copies had been sold, as opposed to one hundred and fifty thousand
in the United States. But if one distinguished writer is to be
believed, this great British interest in the book was due more to
English antipathy to America than to antipathy to slavery<a name=
"FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27">[27]</a>. This writer was
Nassau W. Senior, who, in 1857, published a reprint of his article
on "American Slavery" in the 206th number of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, reintroducing in his book extreme language denunciatory
of slavery that had been cut out by the editor of the
<i>Review</i><a name="FNanchor28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28">[28]</a>. Senior had been stirred to write by the
brutal attack upon Charles Sumner in the United States Senate after
his speech of May 19-20, 1856, evidence, again, that each incident
of the slavery quarrel in America excited British attention.</p>
<p>Senior, like Thomas Gladstone, painted the North as all
anti-slavery, the South as all pro-slavery. Similar impressions of
British understanding (or misunderstanding) are received from the
citations of the British provincial press, so favoured by Garrison
in his <i>Liberator</i><a name="FNanchor29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29">[29]</a>. Yet for intellectual Britain, at
least--that Britain which was vocal and whose opinion can be
ascertained in spite of this constant interest in American slavery,
there was generally a fixed belief that slavery in the United
States was so firmly <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_34"></a>[V1:pg 34]</span> established that it could not be
overthrown. Of what use, then, the further expenditure of British
sympathy or effort in a lost cause? Senior himself, at the
conclusion of his fierce attack on the Southern States, expressed
the pessimism of British abolitionists. He wrote, "We do not
venture to hope that we, or our sons, or our grandsons, will see
American slavery extirpated, or even materially mitigated<a name=
"FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30">[30]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF IMPENDING CONFLICT, 1860-61.</h3>
<br>
<p>It has been remarked by the American historian, Schouler, that
immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War, diplomatic
controversies between England and America had largely been settled,
and that England, pressed from point to point, had "sullenly"
yielded under American demands. This generalization, as applied to
what were, after all, minor controversies, is in great measure
true. In larger questions of policy, as regards spheres of
influence or developing power, or principles of trade, there was
difference, but no longer any essential opposition or declared
rivalry<a name="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31">[31]</a>. In
theories of government there was sharp divergence, clearly
appreciated, however, only in governing-class Britain. This sense
of divergence, even of a certain threat from America to British
political institutions, united with an established opinion that
slavery was permanently fixed in the United States to reinforce
governmental indifference, sometimes even hostility, to America.
The British public, also, was largely hopeless of any change in the
institution of slavery, and its own active humanitarian interest
was waning, though still dormant--not dead. Yet the two nations, to
a degree not true of any other two world-powers, were of the same
race, had similar basic laws, read the same books, and were held in
close touch at many points by the steady flow of British emigration
to the United States.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"></a>[V1:pg 36]</span>
<p>When, after the election of Lincoln to the Presidency, in
November, 1860, the storm-clouds of civil strife rapidly gathered,
the situation took both British Government and people by surprise.
There was not any clear understanding either of American political
conditions, or of the intensity of feeling now aroused over the
question of the extension of slave territory. The most recent
descriptions of America had agreed in assertion that at some future
time there would take place, in all probability, a dissolution of
the Union, on lines of diverging economic interests, but also
stated that there was nothing in the American situation to indicate
immediate progress in this direction. Grattan, a long-time resident
in America as British Consul at Boston, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"The day must no doubt come when clashing objects will
break the ties of common interest which now preserve the Union. But
no man may foretell the period of dissolution.... The many
restraining causes are out of sight of foreign observation. The
Lilliputian threads binding the man mountain are invisible; and it
seems wondrous that each limb does not act for itself independently
of its fellows. A closer examination shows the nature of the
network which keeps the members of this association so tightly
bound. Any attempt to untangle the ties, more firmly fastens them.
When any one State talks of separation, the others become
spontaneously knotted together. When a section blusters about its
particular rights, the rest feel each of theirs to be common to
all. If a foreign nation hint at hostility, the whole Union becomes
in reality united. And thus in every contingency from which there
can be danger, there is also found the element of safety." Yet, he
added, "All attempts to strengthen this federal government at the
expense of the States' governments must be futile.... The federal
government exists on sufferance only. Any State may at any time
constitutionally withdraw from the Union, and thus virtually
dissolve it<a name="FNanchor32"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_32">[32]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"></a>[V1:pg 37]</span>
<p>Even more emphatically, though with less authority, wrote one
Charles Mackay, styled by the American press as a "distinguished
British poet," who made the usual rapid tour of the principal
cities of America in 1857-58, and as rapidly penned his
impressions:</p>
<blockquote>"Many persons in the United States talk of a
dissolution of the Union, but few believe in it.... All this is
mere bravado and empty talk. It means nothing. The Union is dear to
all Americans, whatever they may say to the contrary.... There is
no present danger to the Union, and the violent expressions to
which over-ardent politicians of the North and South sometimes give
vent have no real meaning. The 'Great West,' as it is fondly
called, is in the position even now to arbitrate between North and
South, should the quarrel stretch beyond words, or should
anti-slavery or any other question succeed in throwing any
difference between them which it would take revolvers and rifles
rather than speeches and votes to put an end to<a name=
"FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33">[33]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The slavery controversy in America had, in short, come to be
regarded in England as a constant quarrel between North and South,
but of no immediate danger to the Union. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_38"></a>[V1:pg 38]</span> Each outbreak of
violent American controversy produced a British comment sympathetic
with the North. The turmoil preceding and following the election of
Lincoln in 1860, on the platform of "no extension of slavery," was
very generally noted by the British press and public, as a sign
favourable to the cause of anti-slavery, but with no understanding
that Southern threat would at last be realized in definite action.
Herbert Spencer, in a letter of May 15, 1862, to his American
friend, Yeomans, wrote, "As far as I had the means of judging, the
feeling here was at first <i>very decidedly</i> on the side of the
North<a name="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34">[34]</a> ..."
The British metropolitan press, in nearly every issue of which for
at least two years after December, 1860, there appeared news items
and editorial comment on the American crisis, was at first nearly
unanimous in condemning the South<a name="FNanchor35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35">[35]</a>. The <i>Times</i>, with accustomed vigour,
led the field. On November 21, 1860, it stated:</p>
<blockquote>"When we read the speech of Mr. Lincoln on the subject
of Slavery and consider the extreme moderation of the sentiments it
expresses, the allowance that is made for the situation, for the
feelings, for the prejudices, of the South; when we see how
entirely he narrows his opposition to the single point of the
admission of Slavery into the Territories, we cannot help being
forcibly struck by the absurdity of breaking up a vast and glorious
confederacy like that of the United States from the dread and anger
inspired by the election of such a man to the office of Chief
Magistrate.... We rejoice, on higher and surer grounds, that it
[the election] has ended in the return of Mr. Lincoln. We are glad
to think that the march of Slavery, and the domineering tone which
its advocates were beginning to assume over Freedom, has been at
length arrested and silenced. We rejoice that a vast community of
our own race has at <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_39"></a>[V1:pg 39]</span> length given an authoritative
expression to sentiments which are entertained by everyone in this
country. We trust to see the American Government employed in tasks
more worthy of a State founded on the doctrines of liberty and
equality than the invention of shifts and devices to perpetuate
servitude; and we hear in this great protest of American freedom
the tardy echo of those humane doctrines to which England has so
long become a convert."</blockquote>
<p>Other leading journals, though with less of patronizing
self-complacency, struck the same note as the <i>Times</i>. The
<i>Economist</i> attributed Lincoln's election to a shift in the
sympathies of the "lower orders" in the electorate who had now
deserted their former leaders, the slave-owning aristocracy of the
South, and allied themselves with the refined and wise leaders of
the North. Lincoln, it argued, was not an extremist in any sense.
His plan of action lay within the limits of statesmanlike
moderation<a name="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36">[36]</a>.
The <i>Saturday Review</i> was less sure that England should
rejoice with the North. British self-esteem had suffered some hard
blows at the hands of the Democratic party in America, but at least
England knew where Democrats stood, and could count on no more
discourtesy or injustice than that inflicted in the past. The
Republican party, however, had no policy, except that of its
leader, Seward, and from him might be expected extreme
insolence<a name="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37">[37]</a>.
This was a very early judgment of Seward, and one upon which the
<i>Saturday Review</i> preened itself later, as wholly justified.
The <i>Spectator</i>, the only one of the four journals thus far
considered which ultimately remained constant in advocacy of the
Northern cause, was at first lukewarm in comment, regarding the
1860 election, while fought on the slavery issue, as in reality a
mere contest between parties for political power<a name=
"FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38">[38]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"></a>[V1:pg 40]</span>
<p>Such was the initial attitude of the English press. Each press
issue for several weeks harped on the same chord, though sounding
varying notes. If the South really means forcible resistance, said
the <i>Times</i>, it is doomed to quick suppression. "A few hundred
thousand slave-owners, trembling nightly with visions of murder and
pillage, backed by a dissolute population of 'poor whites,' are no
match for the hardy and resolute populations of the Free
States<a name="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39">[39]</a>,"
and if the South hoped for foreign aid it should be undeceived
promptly: "Can any sane man believe that England and France will
consent, as is now suggested, to stultify the policy of half a
century for the sake of an extended cotton trade, and to purchase
the favours of Charleston and Milledgeville by recognizing what has
been called 'the isothermal law, which impels African labour toward
the tropics' on the other side of the Atlantic<a name=
"FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40">[40]</a>?" Moreover all
Americans ought to understand clearly that British respect for the
United States "was not due to the attitude of the South with its
ruffian demonstrations in Congress.... All that is noble and
venerable in the United States is associated with its Federal
Constitution<a name="FNanchor41"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_41">[41]</a>."</p>
<p>Did the British public hold these same opinions? There is no
direct evidence available in sufficient quantity in autobiography
or letters upon which to base a conclusion. Such works are silent
on the struggle in America for the first few months and presumably
public opinion, less informed even than the press, received its
impressions from the journals customarily read. Both at this period
and all through the war, also, it should be remembered, clearly,
that most newspapers, all the reviews, in fact nearly all vehicles
of British expression, were in the early 'sixties "in the hands of
the educated classes, and these educated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_41"></a>[V1:pg 41]</span> classes
corresponded closely with the privileged classes." The more
democratic element of British Society lacked any adequate press
representation of its opinions. "This body could express itself by
such comparatively crude methods as public meetings and
demonstrations, but it was hampered in literary and political
expression<a name="FNanchor42"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_42">[42]</a>." The opinion of the press was then,
presumably, the opinion of the majority of the educated British
public.</p>
<p>Thus British comment on America took the form, at first of
moralizations, now severe toward the South, now indifferent, yet
very generally asserting the essential justice of the Northern
position. But it was early evident that the newspapers, one and
all, were quite unprepared for the determined front soon put up by
South Carolina and other Southern States. Surprised by the violence
of Southern declarations, the only explanation found by the British
press was that political control had been seized by the uneducated
and lawless element. The <i>Times</i> characterized this element of
the South as in a state of deplorable ignorance comparable with
that of the Irish peasantry, a "poor, proud, lazy, excitable and
violent class, ever ready with knife and revolver<a name=
"FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43">[43]</a>." The fate of the
Union, according to the <i>Saturday Review</i>, was in the hands of
the "most ignorant, most unscrupulous, and most lawless [class] in
the world--the poor or mean whites of the Slave States<a name=
"FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44">[44]</a>." Like judgments
were expressed by the <i>Economist</i> and, more mildly, by the
<i>Spectator</i><a name="FNanchor45"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_45">[45]</a>. Subsequently some of these journals found
difficulty in this connection, in swinging round the circle to
expressions of admiration for the wise and powerful aristocracy of
the South; but all, especially <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_42"></a>[V1:pg 42]</span> the <i>Times</i>, were skilled by
long practice in the journalistic art of facing about while
claiming perfect consistency. In denial of a Southern right of
secession, also, they were nearly a unit<a name=
"FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46">[46]</a>, though the
<i>Saturday Review</i> argued the case for the South, making a
pointed parallel between the present situation and that of the
American Colonies in seceding from England<a name=
"FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47">[47]</a>.</p>
<p>The quotations thus far made exhibit for the leading papers an
initial confusion and ignorance difficult to harmonize with the
theory of an "enlightened press." The Reviews, by the conditions of
publication, came into action more slowly and during 1860 there
appeared but one article, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, giving
any adequate idea of what was really taking place in
America<a name="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48">[48]</a>.
The lesser British papers generally followed the tone of the
leading journals, but without either great interest or much acumen.
In truth the depth of British newspaper ignorance, considering
their positiveness of utterance, appears utterly astonishing if
regarded from the view-point of modern historical knowledge. But is
this, after all, a matter for surprise? Was there not equal
confusion at least, possibly equal ignorance, in America itself,
certainly among the press and people of the Northern States? They
also had come by experience to discount Southern threats, and were
slow to understand that the great conflict of ideals and interests
was at last begun.</p>
<p>The British press both influenced and reflected educated class
opinion, and, in some degree, official opinion as well. Lord John
Russell at the Foreign Office and Lord Lyons, British Minister at
Washington, were exchanging anxious letters, and the latter was
sending home reports remarkable for their clear analysis of the
American controversy. Yet even he was slow to appreciate the
inevitability of secession.</p>

<b>LORD LYONS</b><br>
(<i>From a photograph taken at Boston, U.S.A., in 1860) (From Lord
Newton's "Life of Lord Lyons," by kind permission</i>)</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"></a>[V1:pg 43]</span>
<p>Other officials, especially those in minor positions in the
United States, showed a lack of grasp of the situation similar to
that of the press. An amusing illustration of this, furnishing a
far-fetched view of causes, is supplied in a letter of February 2,
1860, from Consul Bunch, at Charleston, S.C., to Lord Lyons, the
British Minister at Washington<a name="FNanchor49"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_49">[49]</a>. Bunch wrote describing a dinner which had
been given the evening before, by the Jockey Club of Charleston.
Being called upon for a speech, he had alluded to the prizes of the
Turf at home, and had referred especially to the Plates run for the
various British colonies. Continuing, he said:</p>
<blockquote>"'... I cannot help calling your attention to the great
loss you yourselves have suffered by ceasing to be a Colonial
Dependency of Great Britain, as I am sure that if you had continued
to be so, the Queen would have had great pleasure in sending you
some Plates too.'<br>
<br>
"Of course this was meant for the broadest sort of joke, calculated
to raise a laugh after dinner, but to my amazement, the company
chose to take me literally, and applauded for about ten minutes--in
fact I could not go on for some time."</blockquote>
<p>Bunch evidently hardly knew what to make of this demonstration.
He could with difficulty believe that South Carolina wished to be
re-annexed as a colony of Great Britain, and comments upon the
episode in a somewhat humorous vein. Nevertheless in concluding his
letter, he solemnly assures Lord Lyons that</p>
<blockquote>"... The Jockey Club is composed of the 'best people'
of South Carolina--rich planters and the like. It represents,
therefore, the 'gentlemanly interest' and not a bit of universal
suffrage."</blockquote>
<p>It would be idle to assume that either in South Carolina or in
England there was, in February, 1860, any serious thought of a
resumption of colonial relations, though <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_44"></a>[V1:pg 44]</span> W.H. Russell,
correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, reported in the spring, 1861,
that he frequently heard the same sentiment in the South<a name=
"FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50">[50]</a>. For general
official England, as for the press, the truth is that up to the
time of the secession of South Carolina no one really believed that
a final rupture was about to take place between North and South.
When, on December 20, 1860, that State in solemn convention
declared the dissolution "of the Union now existing between South
Carolina and the other States, under the name of the 'United States
of America,'" and when it was understood that other Southern States
would soon follow this example, British opinion believed and hoped
that the rupture would be accomplished peaceably. Until it became
clear that war <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"></a>[V1:pg
45]</span> would ensue, the South was still damned by the press as
seeking the preservation of an evil institution. Slavery was even
more vigorously asserted as the ignoble and sole cause. In the
number for April, 1861, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> attributed the
whole difficulty to slavery, asserted that British sympathy would
be with the anti-slavery party, yet advanced the theory that the
very dissolution of the Union would hasten the ultimate extinction
of slavery since economic competition with a neighbouring free
state, the North, would compel the South itself to abandon its
beloved "domestic institution<a name="FNanchor51"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_51">[51]</a>."</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the news from South Carolina, the <i>Times</i>,
in a long and carefully worded editorial, took up one by one the
alleged causes of secession, dismissed them as inadequate, and
concluded, "... we cannot disguise from ourselves that, apart from
all political complications, there is a right and a wrong in this
question, and that the right belongs, with all its advantages, to
the States of the North<a name="FNanchor52"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_52">[52]</a>." Three days later it asserted, "The North
is for freedom of discussion, the South represses freedom of
discussion with the tar-brush and the pine-fagot." And again, on
January 10, "The Southern States expected sympathy for their
undertaking from the public opinion of this country. The tone of
the press has already done much to undeceive them...."</p>
<p>In general both the metropolitan and the provincial press
expressed similar sentiments, though there were exceptions. The
<i>Dublin News</i> published with approval a long communication
addressed to Irishmen at home and abroad: "... there is no power on
earth or in heaven which can keep in peace this unholy
co-partnership.... I hope ... that the North will quietly permit
the South to retire from the confederacy and bear alone the odium
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"></a>[V1:pg 46]</span>
all mankind<a name="FNanchor53"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_53">[53]</a>...." The <i>Saturday Review</i> thought
that deeper than declared differences lay the ruling social
structure of the South which now visioned a re-opening of the
African Slave Trade, and the occupation by slavery of the whole
southern portion of North America. "A more ignoble basis for a
great Confederacy it is impossible to conceive, nor one in the long
run more precarious.... Assuredly it will be the Northern
Confederacy, based on principles of freedom, with a policy
untainted by crime, with a free working-class of white men, that
will be the one to go on and prosper and become the leader of the
New World<a name="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54">[54]</a>."
The <i>London Chronicle</i> was vigorous in denunciation. "No
country on the globe produces a blackguardism, a cowardice or a
treachery, so consummate as that of the negro-driving States of the
new Southern Confederacy"--a bit of editorial blackguardism in
itself<a name="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55">[55]</a>. The
<i>London Review</i> more moderately stigmatized slavery as the
cause, but was lukewarm in praise of Northern idealisms, regarding
the whole matter as one of diverging economic systems and in any
case as inevitably resulting in dissolution of the Union at some
time. The inevitable might as well come now as later and would
result in benefit to both sections as well as to the world fearing
the monstrous empire of power that had grown up in America<a name=
"FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56">[56]</a>.</p>
<p>The great bulk of early expressions by the British press was, in
truth, definitely antagonistic to the South, and this was
particularly true of the provincial press. Garrison's
<i>Liberator</i>, advocating extreme abolition action, had long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"></a>[V1:pg 47]</span> made
a practice of presenting excerpts from British newspapers, speeches
and sermons in support of its cause. In 1860 there were thirty-nine
such citations; in the first months of 1861 many more, all
condemning slavery and the South. For the most part these citations
represented a comparatively unknown and uninfluential section, both
in politics and literature, of the British people. Matthew Arnold
was among the first of men of letters to record his faith that
secession was final and, as he hoped, an excellent thing for the
North, looking to the purity of race and the opportunity for
unhampered advance<a name="FNanchor57"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_57">[57]</a>. If English writers were in any way
influenced by their correspondents in the United States they may,
indeed, have well been in doubt as to the origin and prospects of
the American quarrel. Hawthorne, but recently at home again after
seven years' consulship in England, was writing that abolition was
not a Northern object in the war just begun. Whittier wrote to
<i>his</i> English friends that slavery, and slavery alone, was the
basic issue<a name="FNanchor58"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_58">[58]</a>. But literary Britain was slow to express
itself save in the Reviews. These, representing varying shades of
British upper-class opinion and presenting articles presumably more
profound than the newspaper editorials, frequently offered more
recondite origins of the American crisis. The <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, organ of extreme Conservatism, in its first article,
dwelt upon the failure of democratic institutions, a topic not here
treated at length since it will be dealt with in a separate chapter
as deserving special study. The <i>Quarterly</i> is also the first
to advance the argument that the protective tariff, advocated by
the North, was a real cause for Southern secession<a name=
"FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59">[59]</a>; an idea made much
of later, by the elements unfriendly to the North, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_48"></a>[V1:pg 48]</span> but not hitherto
advanced. In these first issues of the Reviews for 1861, there was
frequently put forth the "Southern gentlemen" theory.</p>
<blockquote>"At a distance of three thousand miles, the Southern
planters did, indeed, bear a resemblance to the English country
gentleman which led to a feeling of kinship and sympathy with him
on the part of those in England who represented the old traditions
of landed gentility. This 'Southern gentleman' theory, containing
as it did an undeniable element of truth, is much harped upon by
certain of the reviewers, and one can easily conceive of its
popularity in the London Clubs.... The 'American,' so familiar to
British readers, during the first half of the century, through the
eyes of such travellers as Mrs. Trollope, now becomes the 'Yankee,'
and is located north of Mason and Dixon's line<a name=
"FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60">[60]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Such portrayal was not characteristic of all Reviews, rather of
the Tory organs alone, and the Radical <i>Westminster</i> took
pains to deny the truth of the picture, asserting again and again
that the vital and sole cause of the conflict was slavery. Previous
articles are summed up in that of October, 1863, as a profession of
the <i>Westminster's</i> opinion throughout: "... the South are
fighting for liberty to found a Slave Power. Should it prove
successful, truer devil's work, if we may use the metaphor, will
rarely have been done<a name="FNanchor61"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_61">[61]</a>."</p>
<p>Fortunate would it have been for the Northern cause, if British
opinion generally sympathetic at first on anti-slavery grounds, had
not soon found cause to doubt the just basis of its sympathy, from
the trend of events in America. Lincoln had been elected on a
platform opposing the further territorial expansion of slavery. On
that point the North was fairly well united. But the great majority
of those who voted for Lincoln would have indignantly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_49"></a>[V1:pg 49]</span> repudiated any
purpose to take active steps toward the extinction of slavery where
it already existed. Lincoln understood this perfectly, and whatever
his opinion about the ultimate fate of slavery if prohibited
expansion, he from the first took the ground that the terms of his
election constituted a mandate limiting his action. As secession
developed he rightly centred his thought and effort on the
preservation of the Union, a duty imposed by his election to the
Presidency.</p>
<p>Naturally, as the crisis developed, there were many efforts at
still another great compromise. Among the friends of the outgoing
President, Buchanan, whose term of office would not expire until
March 4, 1861, there were still some Southern leaders, like
Jefferson Davis, seeking either a complete surrender to Southern
will, or advantages for Southern security in case secession was
accomplished. Buchanan appealed hysterically to the old-time love
of the Union and to the spirit of compromise. Great congressional
committees of both Senate and House of Representatives were formed
seeking a solution. Crittenden for the border states between North
and South, where, more than anywhere else, there was division of
opinion, proposed pledges to be given to the South. Seward,
long-time champion of the anti-slavery North, was active in the
Senate in suggestion and intrigue seemingly intended to conciliate
by concessions. Charles Francis Adams, early a Free Soiler, in the
House of Representatives Committee conducted his Republican
colleagues along a path apparently leading to a guarantee of
slavery as then established<a name="FNanchor62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62">[62]</a>. A constitutional amendment was drafted to
this effect and received Lincoln's preliminary <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_50"></a>[V1:pg 50]</span> approval. Finally
Lincoln, in his inaugural address, March 4, 1861, declared:</p>
<blockquote>"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere
with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I
believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination
to do so."</blockquote>
<p>It should be no matter for surprise, therefore, that, as these
efforts were observed in Great Britain, a note of uncertainty began
to replace the earlier unanimity of opinion that the future of
slavery was at stake in America. This offered an easy excuse for a
switch-about of sympathy as British commercial and other interests
began to be developed, and even dismayed the ardent friends of the
anti-slavery North. Meanwhile the Government of Great Britain, from
the very first appearance of the cloud of civil war, had focused
its attention on the point of what the events in America portended
to British interests and policy. This is the business of
governments, and their agents would be condemned as inefficient did
they neglect it. But did British governmental policy go beyond this
entirely justifiable first thought for immediate British interests
to the point of positive hope that England would find an advantage
in the breaking up of the great American Republic? American
opinion, both then and later, believed Great Britain guilty of this
offence, but such criticism was tinged with the passions of the
Civil War. Yet a more impartial critic, though possibly an
unfriendly one because of his official position, made emphatic
declaration to like effect. On January 1, 1861, Baron de Brunow,
Russian Ambassador at London, reported to St. Petersburg that, "the
English Government, at the bottom of its heart, desires the
separation of North America into two republics, which will watch
each other jealously and counterbalance one the other. Then
England, on terms of peace and commerce with both, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_51"></a>[V1:pg 51]</span> would have
nothing to fear from either; for she would dominate them,
restraining them by their rival ambitions<a name=
"FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63">[63]</a>."</p>
<p>If, however, one turns from the surmises of foreign diplomats as
to the springs of British policy, to the more authentic evidence of
official and private diplomatic correspondence, there is found no
proof for such accusations. Certainty neither Lord John Russell,
Foreign Secretary, nor Lord Lyons, British Minister at Washington,
reveal any animus against the United States. Considering his many
personal ties with leaders of both factions Lyons, from the first,
reported events with wonderful impartiality, and great clarity. On
November 12, 1860, he sent to Russell a full description of the
clamour raised in the South over the election of Lincoln,
enumerated the resignation of Federal officials (calling these
"ill-judged measures"), and expressed the opinion that Lincoln was
no Radical. He hoped the storm would blow over without damage to
the Union<a name="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64">[64]</a>.
Russell, for his part, was prompt to instruct Lyons and the British
consuls not "to seem to favour one party rather than the other,"
and not to express opinions or to give advice, unless asked for by
the State Governments, in which case the advice should be against
all violent action as tending toward civil war<a name=
"FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65">[65]</a>.</p>
<p>This bare statement may indeed be interpreted as indicating an
eager readiness on Russell's part to accept as final the
dissolution of the Union, but such an interpretation is not borne
out by a reading of his instructions. Rather he was perplexed, and
anxious that British agents should not gain the ill-will of either
American faction, an ill-will that would be alike detrimental in
the future, whether the Union remained unbroken or was
destroyed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"></a>[V1:pg 52]</span>
<p>Strict instructions against offering advice are therefore
repeated frequently<a name="FNanchor66"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_66">[66]</a>. Meanwhile the first concrete problem
requiring British action came from the seizure by South Carolina of
the Federal customs house at the port of Charleston, and the
attempt of the State authorities to collect port dues customarily
paid to Federal officials. British shipowners appealed to Consul
Bunch for instructions, he to Lyons, and the latter to the American
Secretary of State, Judge Black. This was on December 31, 1860,
while Buchanan was still President, and Black's answer was evasive,
though asserting that the United States must technically regard the
events in South Carolina as acts of violent rebellion<a name=
"FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67">[67]</a>. Black refused to
state what action would be taken if Bunch advised British
shipowners to pay, but a way out of the embarrassment was found by
advising such payment to State authorities "under protest" as done
"under compulsion." To one of his letters to Bunch on this topic,
Lyons appended an expression indicative of his own early attitude.
"The domestic slavery of the South is a bitter pill which it will
be hard enough to get the English to swallow. But if the Slave
Trade is to be added to the dose, the least squeamish British
stomach will reject it<a name="FNanchor68"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_68">[68]</a>."</p>
<p>Nevertheless the vigorous action of South Carolina, soon
followed by other Southern States, made a deep impression on
Russell, especially when compared with the uncertainty and
irresolution manifested in the attempted compromise measures of
Northern statesmen. In a private letter to Lyons, January 10, 1861,
he wrote "I do not see how the United States can be cobbled
together again by any compromise.... I cannot see any mode of
reconciling such <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"></a>[V1:pg
53]</span> parties as these. The best thing <i>now</i> would be
that the right to secede should be acknowledged.... I hope sensible
men will take this view.... But above all I hope no force will be
used<a name="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69">[69]</a>." And
again twelve days later, "I suppose the break-up of the Union is
now inevitable<a name="FNanchor70"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_70">[70]</a>." To Russell, as to most foreign observers,
it seemed that if the South with its great wealth, its enormous
extent of territory, and its five and one-half millions of
population, were determined to leave the Union, no force whatever
could compel a return. History failed to record any revolution on
so large a scale which had not succeeded. His desire, therefore,
was that the North would yield to the inevitable, and would not
plunge into a useless civil war disastrous alike to the prosperity
of America and of foreign nations. Russell's first hope was that
the South would forgo secession; his second, this accomplished,
that there would be no war, and in this sense he instructed Lyons.
The latter, less expectant of peaceful separation, and more aware
of the latent power of the North, maintained throughout his entire
service at Washington that there was at least a <i>chance</i> that
the North could subdue the South by might of arms<a name=
"FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71">[71]</a>, but he also,
looking to British interests, saw his early duty, before war broke,
in cautious suggestions against forcible Northern action. Thus from
January to March, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_54"></a>[V1:pg 54]</span> 1861, British effort and indirect
advice were based on the hope that British trade interests might
escape the tribulations inevitable from a civil conflict in
America. Beyond that point there was no grasp of the complications
likely to arise in case of war, and no clear formulation of British
policy<a name="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72">[72]</a>.</p>
<p>In fact up to the middle of March, 1861, both public and
official British opinion discounted armed conflict, or at least any
determined Northern effort to recover the South. Early British
attitude was, therefore, based on a misconception. As this became
clear, public opinion began to break from a united humanitarian
pro-Northern sentiment and to show, in some quarters, quite another
face. Even as early as January the <i>Economist</i> expressed
wonder that the Northern States had not availed themselves gladly
of the chance to "shake off such an incubus, and to purify
themselves of such a stain<a name="FNanchor73"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_73">[73]</a>." and a month later professed to believe
that Great Britain would willingly permit the North to secure
compensation for loss of territory by annexing Canada--provided the
Canadians themselves desired it. This, it was argued, would
directly benefit England herself by cutting down military
expenditures<a name="FNanchor74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74">[74]</a>. The <i>London Press</i> indulged in
similar speculation, though from the angle of a Canadian annexation
of the Northern States, whose more sober citizens must by now be
weary of the sham of American democracy, and disgusted with the
rowdyism of political elections, which "combine the morals of a
horse race, the manners of a dog fight, the passions of a tap-room,
and the emotions of a gambling <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_55"></a>[V1:pg 55]</span> house<a name=
"FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75">[75]</a>." Probably such
suggestions had little real purpose or meaning at the moment, but
it is interesting that this idea of a "compensation" in Canada
should have been voiced thus early. Even in the United States the
same thought had occurred to a few political leaders. Charles
Sumner held it, though too wise, politically, to advance it in the
face of the growing Northern determination to preserve the Union.
It lay at the bottom of his increasing bitterness toward his old
friend Charles Francis Adams, now busy in schemes intended,
apparently, to restore the Union by compromise, and it led Sumner
to hope for appointment as Minister to England<a name=
"FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76">[76]</a>.</p>
<p>The chief organ of British upper-class opinion, the
<i>Times</i>, was one of the first to begin the process of "face
about," as civil war in America seemed imminent<a name=
"FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77">[77]</a>. Viewed from the
later attitude of the <i>Times</i>, the earlier expressions of that
paper, and in truth of many British journals, seem merely the
customary platitudinous British holding up of horrified hands at
American slavery. On January 19, 1861, a strong editorial still
proclaimed the folly of South Carolina, as acting "without law,
without justice," but displayed a real dismay at the possible
consequences of war to British trade and commerce. On January 22,
the <i>Times</i> reprinted an article from the <i>Economist</i>, on
a probable cessation of cotton supply and editorially professed
great alarm, even advocating an early recognition of the Southern
confederacy if needed to maintain that supply. From this time on
there <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"></a>[V1:pg 56]</span>
is no further note in the <i>Times</i> of the righteousness of the
Northern cause; but while it is still asserted that war would be
folly, the strength of the South, its superiority as a military
nation, are depicted.</p>
<p>A long break of nearly six weeks follows with little editorial
comment. Soon the correspondence from New York, previously written
by Bancroft Davis, and extremely favourable to the Northern cause,
was discontinued. W.H. Russell, the famous war correspondent of the
Crimea, was summoned to London and, according to his own story,
upon being given papers, clippings, and correspondence (largely
articles from the <i>New York Herald</i>) supporting the right of
the South to secede, hastily took his departure for America to
report upon the situation<a name="FNanchor78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78">[78]</a>. He sailed from Queenstown on March 3, and
arrived in New York on March 16. At last on March 12, the
<i>Times</i> took positive ground in favour of the justice of the
Southern cause.</p>
<blockquote>"No treachery has been at work to produce the
disruption, and the principles avowed are such as to command the
sympathies of every free and enlightened people. Such are the
widely different auspices under which the two rival Republics start
into existence. But mankind will not ultimately judge these things
by sympathies and antipathies; they will be greatly swayed by their
own interest, and the two Republics must be weighed, not by their
professions or their previous history, but by the conduct they
pursue and the position they maintain among the Powers of the
earth. Their internal institutions are their own affair; their
financial and political arrangements are emphatically ours. Brazil
is a slave-holding Empire, but by its good faith and good conduct
it has contrived to establish for itself a place in the hierarchy
of nations far superior to that of many Powers which are free from
this domestic contamination. If the Northern Confederacy of America
evinces a determination to act in a narrow, exclusive, and unsocial
spirit, while its Southern competitor <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_57"></a>[V1:pg 57]</span> extends the hand
of good fellowship to all mankind, with the exception of its own
bondsmen, we must not be surprised to see the North, in spite of
the goodness of its cause and the great negative merit of the
absence of Slavery, sink into a secondary position, and lose the
sympathy and regard of mankind."</blockquote>
<p>This to Northern view, was a sad relapse from that high moral
tone earlier addressed to the South notifying slave-holders that
England would not "stultify the policy of half a century for the
sake of an extended cotton trade<a name="FNanchor79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79">[79]</a>."</p>
<p>The <i>Economist</i>, with more consistency, still reported the
violence and recklessness of the South, yet in logical argument
proved to its own satisfaction the impossibility of Northern
reconquest, and urged a peaceful separation<a name=
"FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80">[80]</a>. The
<i>Spectator</i>, even though pro-Northern, had at first small hope
of reunion by force, and offered consolation in the thought that
there would still remain a United States of America "strong,
powerful and free; all the stronger for the loss of the Black
South<a name="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81">[81]</a>." In
short from all quarters the public press, whatever its sympathy,
united in decrying war as a useless effort doomed to failure if
undertaken in the hope of restoring the Union. Such public opinion,
however, was not necessarily governmental opinion. The latter was
indeed more slow to make up its mind and more considerate in
expressing itself. When it became clear that in all probability the
North would fight, there was still no conception, any more than in
the United States itself, of the duration and intensity of the
conflict. Indeed, Russell yet hoped, as late as the end of January,
that no protracted war would occur. Nevertheless he was compelled
to face the situation in its relation to British commerce.</p>
<p>On February 16, Russell addressed Lyons on that aspect of
possible war which would at once call for a determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"></a>[V1:pg 58]</span> of
British policy. "Above all things," he wrote, "endeavour to prevent
a blockade of the Southern coast. It would produce misery, discord,
and enmity incalculable<a name="FNanchor82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82">[82]</a>." Within a week Forster, a thorough friend
of the North throughout the whole war, was interrogating the
Ministry in the House of Commons in regard to the situation at
Charleston, and expressing the hope that England would not in any
way attempt to interfere<a name="FNanchor83"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_83">[83]</a>. This was the first reference in
Parliament, its sittings but just renewed after the long vacation,
to the American conflict, but British commercial interests were
being forced to a keener attention, and already men in many circles
were asking themselves what should be the proper governmental
attitude; how soon this new Southern Confederacy could justly claim
European recognition; how far and how fast European governments
ought to go in acknowledging such a claim; what ought to be the
proper policy and position of a neutral power; whether, indeed, a
declaration of neutrality ought to be issued.</p>
<p>With these questions rapidly coming to the front, it became
important for British statesmen to know something about the leaders
in this new Southern movement, the attitude of the people in
general, and the purposes of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_59"></a>[V1:pg 59]</span> new Government. Here,
unfortunately, Lord Lyons could be no guide. The consuls in the
South, however, were in a position to give their impressions. On
February 28, 1861, Bunch wrote to Russell, describing the election
of Davis and Stephens<a name="FNanchor84"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_84">[84]</a>, to the Presidency and Vice-Presidency of
the Confederacy, and giving a personal characterization of many
members of the Government. He was rather caustic. Davis, he said,
was the only <i>able</i> man, and he, unfortunately, was a
confirmed "manifest destiny" leader, so much so in fact that Bunch
prophesied a renewal of filibustering when once the North had
acquiesced in a Southern State and the fear of the North had
passed. Bunch had no faith in any future greatness of the South,
asserting that it would be a State despised among nations for its
maintenance of slavery, and that it could not hope for any
encouragement or sympathy from the humane nations of Europe; in
fact, his entire characterization was wholly damning to the South.
Yet it is to be noted that he never for a moment questioned that
the South had already actually established its independence. This
he seems to take for granted. Thus again, and from another quarter,
there was presented the double difficulty of England in regard to
the Civil War--the difficulty of reconciling sentiments of humanity
long preached by Great Britain, with her commercial interests and
her certainty that a new State was being born.</p>
<p>For men in the Northern Government Lyons was in a position to
report, but up to the end of January he had not written in any
great detail with regard to the new administration and its make-up,
though on January 7, he had informed Russell that Seward would be
the Secretary of State and had expressed the fear that with regard
to Great Britain he would be "a dangerous Foreign Minister<a name=
"FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85">[85]</a>." Lincoln was
still in Illinois and the constituency of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_60"></a>[V1:pg 60]</span> Cabinet was yet
uncertain, but Seward's voice was sure to be a powerful one.
Occasionally Lyons found some opportunity to talk with him. On
February 4, 1861, in an official letter to Russell, Lyons reported
at length an interview with Seward, in which the latter had
expressed his extreme confidence that the trouble in America was
but superficial and that union sentiment in the South would soon
prevail<a name="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86">[86]</a>. In
a private letter of the same date, however, Lyons asserted that
Seward was indeed likely to be a very dangerous Secretary of State.
He had told Lyons that if European governments interfered to
protect their commerce, he could unite America by a foreign war in
order to resist such interference<a name="FNanchor87"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_87">[87]</a>. Again, on February 12, while himself
expressing hope that a solution might be found for the difficulties
in America, Lyons warned Russell that there were those who would
solve these difficulties by a foreign war, especially if foreign
governments refused to acknowledge a United States declaration
without formal blockade closing the Southern ports<a name=
"FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88">[88]</a>. Writing
privately, Lyons exhibited great anxiety in regard to Seward's
attitude and suggested that the best safeguard would be close union
by England and France, for if these two governments took exactly
the same stand in regard to trade, Seward would hardly dare to
carry out his threat<a name="FNanchor89"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_89">[89]</a>.</p>
<p>Lyons' letter of February 4 called out from Russell an
instruction in which it was repeated that advice to either party
should be withheld and a strictly neutral attitude maintained, and
Russell concluded by an assertion that if the United States
attempted a jingo policy toward England, the British Cabinet would
be tolerant because of its feeling of strength but that "blustering
demonstrations" must <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_61"></a>[V1:pg 61]</span> not be carried too far<a name=
"FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90">[90]</a>. Even as early as
December, 1860, Russell had foreseen the possibility of what he
considered a mere jingo policy for home effect in America. Now,
however, upon the repeated expression of fears from Lyons that this
might be more than mere "bunkum," Russell began to instruct Lyons
not to permit English dignity to be infringed, while at the same
time desiring him to be cautious against stirring American
antagonism. Lyons' earlier disquietude seems, indeed, to have
passed away for a time, and on February 26 he wrote that everyone
was waiting to see what Lincoln would do when inaugurated, that
there was still hope of compromise, and that in his own view this
was still possible. In this letter the tone is more important than
the matter, and so far as Lyons is concerned the tone is all
distinctly hopeful, all favourable to a resumption of normal
relations between the North and South. He at least had no hope of
disruption, and no happiness in it<a name="FNanchor91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91">[91]</a>.</p>
<p>Before this communication could reach England Russell had
thoroughly awakened to the seriousness of the American situation in
relation to British foreign trade. On March 9, writing privately to
Lyons, he stated, "I hope you are <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_62"></a>[V1:pg 62]</span> getting on well with the new
President. If he blockades the Southern ports we shall be in a
difficulty. But according to all American doctrine it must be an
actual blockade kept up by an efficient force<a name=
"FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92">[92]</a>." Thus, before any
act had really occurred in America, the matter of a blockade was
occupying the attention of British statesmen. One difficulty at the
time was that there was no one in England qualified to speak for
the new administration at Washington. Dallas, the American Minister
appointed under the Buchanan administration, while, unlike some
other diplomatic representatives abroad, faithful to the cause of
the United States, was nevertheless not wholly trusted by Lincoln
or by Seward, and was thus handicapped in representing to Russell
American conditions or intentions. Indeed he had very little
communication with Russell. Adams' nomination to England was known
to Lyons on March 20, for on that day he telegraphed to Russell,
"Mr. Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts, is appointed Minister
in London. I think it a very good appointment<a name=
"FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93">[93]</a>." This news was
received in London on April 2, but over six weeks were yet to
elapse before Adams reached his post. The appointment of Adams,
however, seemed to Lyons a matter of congratulation in his hope
that no vicious anti-British policy would be indulged in by Seward.
Ten days after his telegram, he wrote at length to Russell, making
an excellent statement and analysis in regard to the character of
Adams.</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Adams is son of John Quincy Adams, the fifth P. of
the U.S., and grandson of John Adams, the second P. The grandfather
was the first Am. minister in England. The father was one of the
Plenipotentiaries who signed in London the Convention of the 3rd
July, 1815. Mr. Adams as a member of the H. of R. for one of the
districts of Mass., acted with the less violent section of the
'Republican' Party. During the last session of Congress he made a
very <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"></a>[V1:pg 63]</span>
remarkable speech on the state of the Union, denying the
reasonableness of the complaints of the Southern States, but
stating his desire that every concession not inconsistent with
honour and principle should be made to them. He is considered to be
a man of great independence of character, and has the reputation of
being very tenacious of his own opinions. In manner he is quiet and
unassuming. He is a man of good fortune. Mrs. Adams comes of a
considerable family in Mass., of the name of Brooks. The late wife
of Mr. Edward Everett, who, as your L. is aware, has held the
offices of Minister in London and Secretary of State, was her
sister<a name="FNanchor94"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_94">[94]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Similar characterizations were being forwarded at almost the
same time by Bunch in regard to the Southern Commissioners, now
being despatched to London, but they were not so favourable. Mann,
wrote Bunch, was the son of a "bankrupt grocer." His personal
character was "not good," yet he alone of the three Commissioners
appointed had had diplomatic experience. Yancey, it was stated, was
an able lawyer, a stirring orator, and a recognized leader of the
secession movement, but he was also extremely pro-slavery in his
views, had expressed himself in favour of a renewal of the slave
trade, and throughout his career had been a "manifest destiny" man.
Of Rost, Bunch had no knowledge. In conclusion Bunch described the
extreme confidence expressed in the South in "King Cotton," and in
rather bitter criticism stated that the Southern Commissioners
thought even England, the foe of slavery, would now be compelled to
bend the knee and recognize the South in order to get
cotton<a name="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95">[95]</a>.</p>
<p>The Northern British Consuls on the other hand took an
astonishingly pro-Northern view of the whole situation. Archibald,
consul at New York, wrote to Russell soon after the fall of Sumter,
an exceedingly strong statement of his <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_64"></a>[V1:pg 64]</span> faith in the
power of the North and its fixed and unalterable determination to
force the South back into the Union, his confidence in Northern
success, and his belief in the justice of the Northern cause. He
ventured to suggest the proper policy for England to pursue, viz.,
to offer immediately her services in mediation but wholly and
clearly on the side of the North. He stated that if England did not
feel free to offer mediation, she should at least show "such a
consistent and effective demonstration of sympathy and aid" for the
North as would help in shortening the war<a name=
"FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96">[96]</a>. The British
Consul at Boston wrote to Russell in much the same vein. So far,
indeed, did these men go in expressing their sympathy with the
North, that Lyons, on April 27, commented to Russell that these
consuls had "taken the Northern War Fever," and that he had mildly
reproved Archibald<a name="FNanchor97"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_97">[97]</a>.</p>
<p>With the inauguration of Lincoln on March 4, and the
installation of Seward as Secretary of State, it was possible for
Lyons to become more active in his efforts to prevent a disruption
of British Trade. On March 20 he told Seward in a confidential
conversation:</p>
<blockquote>"... If the United States determined to stop by force
so important a commerce as that of Great Britain with the
cotton-growing States, I could not answer for what might
happen.<br>
<br>
"... It was, however, a matter of the greatest consequence to
England to procure cheap cotton. If a considerable rise were to
take place in the price of cotton, and British ships were to be at
the same time excluded from the Southern Ports, an immense pressure
would be put upon Her Majesty's Government to use all the means in
their power to open those ports. If Her Majesty's Government felt
it to be their duty to do so, they would naturally endeavour to
effect their object in a manner as consistent as possible, first
with their friendly feelings towards both Sections of this Country,
and secondly with <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_65"></a>[V1:pg 65]</span> the recognized principles of
International Law. As regards the latter point in particular, it
certainly appeared that the most simple, if not the only way, would
be to recognize the Southern Confederacy<a name=
"FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98">[98]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was plain speaking, and Lyons' threat of recognizing the
South did not at the moment stir Seward to any retort. But five
days later, on March 25, Lyons gave a dinner to Seward and a number
of the foreign Ministers, and there Seward's violent talk about
seizing any and all ships that tried to trade with the South, even
if there was no blockade, made Lyons very anxious. As a host he
diverted the conversation lest it become too acrimonious, but he
himself told Seward</p>
<blockquote>"... that it was really a matter so very serious that I
was unwilling to discuss it; that his plan seemed to me to amount
in fact to a paper blockade of the enormous extent of coast
comprised in the seceding States; that the calling it an
enforcement of the Revenue Laws appeared to me to increase the
gravity of the measure, for it placed Foreign Powers in the dilemma
of recognizing the Southern Confederation or of submitting to the
interruption of their commerce<a name="FNanchor99"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_99">[99]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lyons' advice to Russell was that no rebuff should be given the
Southern Commissioners when they arrived in London, but that they
be treated well. This, he thought, might open Seward's eyes to his
folly. Still Lyons did not yet fully believe that Seward would be
so vigorous as his language seemed to imply, and on March 29 he
wrote that "prudent counsels" were in the ascendant, that there
would be no interference with trade "<i>at present</i>," and that a
quieter tone was everywhere perceptible in Washington<a name=
"FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100">[100]</a>.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the British Minister at <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_66"></a>[V1:pg 66]</span> Washington, the
danger spot in relations between the United States and Great
Britain lay in this matter of interference with trade to Southern
ports. Naturally, and as in duty bound, he sought to preserve that
trade. At first, indeed, he seems to have thought that even though
a civil war really ensued the trade might continue uninterrupted.
Certainly he bore hard and constantly on this one point, seeking to
influence not only officials at Washington but the public press.
Thus, in a letter to Bunch dated April 12, 1861, at a time when he
knew that W.H. Russell, the <i>Times</i> correspondent, would
shortly appear in Charleston, he instructed Bunch to remember that
in talking to Russell he must especially impress him with the idea
that any interruption of trade might and probably would result in a
British recognition of the South. Lyons wrote, "... the <i>only</i>
chance, if chance there still be of preventing an interruption of
the English commerce with the S. is the fear entertained here, that
it would lead to our recognizing the S.C.<a name=
"FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101">[101]</a>" In these words
is revealed, however, as in other communications from Lyons, the
fact that he was striving to prevent an interruption of trade
rather than that he was convinced such interruption ought to result
in a British recognition of the South. Indeed, as will be seen,
when the blockade was at last declared, Lyons thought it no cause
for recognition and was most tolerant of its early
ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>While Lyons was thus keeping in close touch with Seward, the
relations between England and America at London were exceedingly
meagre. All that the American Minister Dallas knew of Russell's
intentions is summed up in his despatches to Seward of March 22 and
April 9, 1861<a name="FNanchor102"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_102">[102]</a>. On the former date, he gave an account
of an interview with Russell in which the latter simply refused to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67"></a>[V1:pg 67]</span>
pledge himself against a recognition of the Confederacy; in the
latter, presenting a long memorial written by Seward to all of the
larger European Governments arguing in friendly spirit the cause of
the North, Dallas reported that he drew from Russell merely a
general expression of England's kindly feeling towards the United
States and her hope that there might still be a peaceful solution.
Russell again refused to make any pledge in regard to English
policy. In this interview it was tacitly agreed that it would be
better for Great Britain to await Adams' arrival before taking any
definite action, or so at least Dallas understood Russell--though
the latter later denied that any pledge of delay was given. There
is no doubt, however, that in Russell's mind, whatever he might say
to Dallas, the separation in America was an accomplished fact and
the hope of Great Britain was centred upon the idea of a peaceful
separation.</p>
<p>Up to and including April 1, indeed, Lyons had been reporting
that no definite stand was yet being taken by the American
Government. At the same time Russell was continuing his
instructions to Lyons to recommend conciliation "but never to
obtrude advice unasked<a name="FNanchor103"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_103">[103]</a>." Yet Russell was not wholly undisturbed
by the reports of Seward's quarrelsome attitude, for in a private
letter of the same date as the preceding, he wrote to Lyons, "I
rely upon your wisdom, patience, and prudence, to steer us through
the dangers of this crisis. If it can possibly be helped Mr. Seward
must not be allowed to get us into a quarrel. I shall see the
Southerners when they come, but not officially, and keep them at a
proper distance<a name="FNanchor104"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_104">[104]</a>." It is an interesting query, whether
this fear thus expressed of Seward's temper was not of distinct
benefit to the United States at the moment when the Southern
Commissioners <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"></a>[V1:pg
68]</span> arrived in England. The inference would seem to be
clear, that in spite of Lyons' advice to treat them well, the
effect upon Russell of Seward's attitude was to treat them coolly.
Russell was indeed distinctly worried by Seward's unfriendly
attitude.</p>
<p>In the meantime the British press and public, while still
uncertain and divided as to the merits of the conflict were now
substantially a unit in accepting separation as final. The
<i>Times</i>, with judicial ponderosity declared: "The new
nationality has been brought forth after a very short period of
gestation.... and the Seceding States have now constituted
themselves a nation<a name="FNanchor105"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_105">[105]</a> ..." At the other end of the scale in
newspaper "tone," the <i>London Press</i> jeered at the Northern
American eagle as having "had his tail pulled out and his wings
clipped--yet the meek bird now holds out his claws to be pared,
with a resignation that would be degrading in the most henpecked of
domestic fowls<a name="FNanchor106"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_106">[106]</a>." Having now veered about to expressions
of confidence in the permanency of the Southern Confederacy the
<i>Times</i> was also compelled to alter its opinion of Southern
Statesmen. An editorial gave high praise to the Confederate
Congress sitting at Montgomery, stated its personnel to be far
superior to that of the Congress at Washington, yet was unable to
resist making the customary reference to manners traditionally
American;</p>
<blockquote>"With regard to the Congress itself, we cannot refrain
from quoting the <i>na&iuml;ve</i> testimony of a visitor in its
favour. 'Gentlemen here [Montgomery] who have spent much time in
Washington city declare that they have never witnessed such
industry, care, propriety, courtesy, and pleasant Congressional
action. <i>Not one member has appeared in his seat under the
influence of liquors or wines</i>, not a harsh word <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_69"></a>[V1:pg 69]</span> has been uttered
in debate, and all exhibit the most unflagging energy and
determination<a name="FNanchor107"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_107">[107]</a>.'"</blockquote>
<p>The most of the British press quickly followed the lead of the
<i>Times</i>, forgot its previous dictum that the South was in the
control of "ignorant ruffians," and dilated upon the statemanlike
directness and sagacity of Southern leaders as contrasted with the
stupidity of the North, displayed in its tariff policy<a name=
"FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108">[108]</a>. A few journals
thought that the North might eventually win in a prolonged struggle
but that such a victory would be disastrous to the principles of
federalism<a name="FNanchor109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109">[109]</a>, and, in any case, that this civil war
was one without "a noble cause to sustain either side<a name=
"FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110">[110]</a>." By May nearly
all the older journals were aligned on the right of the South to
secede, and on the fact of a successful secession, though still
differing as to the basic causes and essential justice involved. In
this same month, however, there emerged a few vigorous champions of
the Northern cause and prospects. In April the <i>Spectator</i>
agreed that the Great Republic was at an end<a name=
"FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111">[111]</a>; in May it
urged the North to fight it out with hope, asserting a chance of
ultimate victory because of superior resources and the sympathy of
all European nations<a name="FNanchor112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112">[112]</a>. A small newspaper of limited
circulation, the <i>Morning Star</i>, organ of John Bright, had
from the first championed the Northern cause. Now, as the armed
conflict broke in America, it was joined by a more important paper,
the <i>Daily News</i>, which set itself the task of controverting
the <i>Times</i>. Moreover the <i>Daily News</i> was all the more
influential in that it was not uncritical of the North, yet
consistently, throughout the war, expressed sympathy for the cause
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70"></a>[V1:pg 70]</span>
principles behind the efforts of the Northern Government. Selling
for a low price, twopence-halfpenny, the <i>Daily News</i>, like
the <i>Westminster</i> among the Reviews, appealed to a broader and
more popular constituency than the older publications, especially
to a constituency not yet vocal, since still unrepresented, in
Parliament<a name="FNanchor113"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_113">[113]</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Daily News</i> was fortunate in having, after 1862, the
best-informed New York correspondent writing to the London press.
This was an Irishman, E.L. Godkin, who, both at home and in
America, was the intimate friend of literary men, and himself,
later, a great moulder of public opinion<a name=
"FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114">[114]</a>. Harriet
Martineau further aided the <i>Daily News</i> by contributing
pro-Northern articles, and was a power in Radical circles<a name=
"FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115">[115]</a>. But literary
England in general, was slow to express itself with conviction,
though Robert Browning, by April, 1861, was firmly determined in
his pro-Northern sentiment. In August he was writing in letters of
the "good cause<a name="FNanchor116"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_116">[116]</a>." But Browning was a rare exception and
it was not until the Civil War had been under way for many months
that men of talent in the non-political world were drawn to make
comment or to take sides. Their influence at the outset was
negligible<a name="FNanchor117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117">[117]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"></a>[V1:pg 71]</span>
<p>In spite of press utterances, or literary silence, alike
indicative of a widespread conviction that Southern independence
was assured, there still remained both in those circles where
anti-slavery sentiment was strong, and in others more neutral in
sympathy, a distaste for the newly-born State as the embodiment of
a degrading institution. Lincoln's inaugural address denying an
intention to interfere with slavery was a weapon for the friends of
the South, but it could not wholly still that issue. Even in the
<i>Times</i>, through the medium of W.H. Russell's descriptive
letters, there appeared caustic criticisms. He wrote in his
"Diary," "I declare that to me the more orderly, methodical, and
perfect the arrangements for economizing slave labour ... are, the
more hateful and odious does slavery become<a name=
"FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118">[118]</a>," and in his
letter of May 8, from Montgomery, having witnessed an auction sale
of slaves he stated:</p>
<blockquote>"I am neither sentimentalist nor Black Republican, nor
negro worshipper, but I confess the sight caused a strange thrill
through my heart. I tried in vain to make myself familiar with the
fact that I could, for the sum of $975, become as absolutely the
owner of that mass of blood, bones, sinew, flesh and brains as of
the horse which stood by my side. There was no sophistry which
could persuade me the man was not a man--he was, indeed, by no
means my brother, but assuredly he was a fellow creature<a name=
"FNanchor119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119">[119]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was hard printing for the <i>Times</i>, in its new advocacy
of the South, and Russell's description was made much of by the
<i>Westminster Review</i> and other publications that soon began to
sound again the "issue" of slavery<a name=
"FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120">[120]</a>. Yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72"></a>[V1:pg 72]</span>
<i>Westminster</i> itself in the same article decried the folly of
the Northern attempt at reconquest. So also thought even John
Bright at the moment, when expressing himself privately to friends
in America<a name="FNanchor121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121">[121]</a>.</p>
<p>Slavery, then, still remained an issue before the British
public, but of what use was it to upbraid the South, if a new world
State were in fact born? And if a State in power, why not give it
prompt recognition? The extreme British anti-slavery opponents
feared that this was just what the Government was inclined to do,
and with promptness. Here and there meetings were hurriedly called
to protest against recognition<a name="FNanchor122"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_122">[122]</a>. This fear was unfounded. Neither in
London nor at Washington was there any official inclination to
hasten recognition. Lyons had held up to Seward the logic of such
action, if British trade were illegally interfered with. By April 9
Lyons was aware that the so-called Radical Party in the Cabinet
would probably have its way, that conciliation would no longer be
attempted, and that a coercive policy toward the South was soon to
follow. On that date he wrote to Russell stating that people in
Washington seemed so convinced that Europe would <i>not</i>
interfere to protect its trade that they were willing to venture
any act embarrassing to that trade. He himself was still insisting,
but with dwindling confidence, that the trade must not be
interfered with under any circumstances. And in a second letter of
this same date, he repeated to Russell his advice of treating the
Southern Commissioners with deference. Any rebuff to them, he
asserts again, will but increase the Northern confidence that they
may do anything without provoking the resistance of England<a name=
"FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123">[123]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"></a>[V1:pg 73]</span>
<p>Like a good diplomat Lyons was merely pushing the argument for
all it was worth, hoping to prevent an injury to his country, yet
if that injury did come (provided it were sanctioned by the law of
nations) he did not see in it an injury sufficient to warrant
precipitate action by Great Britain. When indeed the Southern
capture of Fort Sumter in Charleston harbour finally brought the
actual clash of arms, Lyons expressed himself with regard to other
elements in the struggle previously neglected in his
correspondence. On April 15 describing to Russell the fall of
Sumter, he stated that civil war had at last begun. The North he
believed to be very much more powerful than the South, the South
more "eager" and united as yet, but, he added, "the taint of
slavery will render the cause of the South loathsome to the
civilized world." It was true that "commercial intercourse with the
cotton States is of vital importance to manufacturing
nations<a name="FNanchor124"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_124">[124]</a>...." but Lyons was now facing an actual
situation rather than a possible one, and as will be seen later, he
soon ceased to insist that an interruption of this "commercial
intercourse" gave reasonable ground for recognition of the
South.</p>
<p>With the fall of Fort Sumter and the European recognition that a
civil war was actually under way in America, a large number of new
and vexing problems was presented to Russell. His treatment of them
furnishes the subject matter of later chapters. For the period
previous to April, 1861, British official attitude may be summed up
in the statement that the British Minister at Washington hoped
against hope that some solution might be found for the preservation
of the Union, but that at the same time, looking to future British
interests and possibly believing also that his attitude would tend
to preserve the Union, he asserted vehemently the impossibility of
any Northern interference with British trade to Southern ports.
Across <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"></a>[V1:pg
74]</span> the water, Russell also hoped faintly that there might
be no separation. Very soon, however, believing that separation
inevitable and the disruption of the Union final, he fixed his hope
on peaceful rather than warlike secession. Even of this, however,
he had little real expectation, but neither he nor anyone else in
England, nor even in America, had any idea that the war would be a
long and severe one. It is evident that he was already considering
the arrival of that day when recognition must be granted to a new,
independent and slave-holding State. But this estimate of the
future is no proof that the Russian Ambassador's accusation of
British governmental pleasure in American disruption was
justified<a name="FNanchor125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125">[125]</a>. Russell, cautious in refusing to pledge
himself to Dallas, was using exactly such caution as a Foreign
Secretary was bound to exercise. He would have been a rash man who,
in view of the uncertainty and irresolution of Northern statesmen,
would have committed Great Britain in March, 1861, to a definite
line of policy.</p>
<p>On April 6, Russell was still instructing Lyons to recommend
reconciliation. April 8, Dallas communicated to Russell an
instruction from Seward dated March 9, arguing on lines of
"traditional friendship" against a British recognition of the
Confederacy. Russell again refused to pledge his Government, but on
April 12 he wrote to Lyons that British Ministers were "in no hurry
to recognize the separation as complete and final<a name=
"FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126">[126]</a>." In the early
morning of that same day the armed conflict in America had begun,
and on the day following, April 13, the first Southern victory had
been recorded in the capture of Fort Sumter. The important question
which the man at the head of the British Foreign Office had now
immediately to decide was, what was to be England's attitude, under
international <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"></a>[V1:pg
75]</span> law, toward the two combatants in America. In deciding
this question, neither sentiment nor ideals of morality, nor
humanitarianism need play any part; England's <i>first</i> need and
duty were to determine and announce for the benefit of her citizens
the correct position, under International law, which must be
assumed in the presence of certain definite facts.</p>

Boston, 1863, p. 134. "Then cropped out again the expression of
regret for the rebellion of 1776, and the desire that if it came to
the worst, England would receive back her erring children, or give
them a prince under whom they could secure a monarchical form of
government. There is no doubt about the earnestness with which
these things are said." Russell's <i>Diary</i> is largely a
condensation of his letters to the <i>Times</i>. In the letter of
April 30, 1861 (published May 28), he dilates to the extent of a
column on the yearning of South Carolina for a restoration of
colonial relations. But Consul Bunch on December 14, 1860, reported
a Charleston sentiment very different from that of the Jockey Club
in February. He wrote to Lyons:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"The church bells are ringing like mad in celebration
of a<br>
newly revived festival, called 'Evacuation Day,' being the<br>
<i>nefastus ille dies</i> in which the bloody Britishers left<br>
Charleston 78 years ago. It has fallen into utter disuse for<br>
about 50 years, but is now suddenly resuscitated apropos
<i>de</i><br>
nothing at all."</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
In this same letter Bunch described a Southern patriotic
demonstration. Returning to his home one evening, he met a military
company, which from curiosity he followed, and which<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"drew up in front of the residence of a young lawyer of
my<br>
friends, after performing in whose honour, through the medium<br>
of a very brassy band, a Secession Schottische or Palmetto<br>
Polka, it clamorously demanded his presence. After a very<br>
brief interval he appeared, and altho' he is in private life<br>
an agreeable and moderately sensible young man, he succeeded,<br>
to my mind at any rate, in making most successfully, what Mr.<br>
Anthony Weller calls 'an Egyptian Mummy of his self.' the<br>
amount of balderdash and rubbish which he evacuated (<i>dia<br>
stomatos</i>) about mounting the deadly breach, falling back<br>
into the arms of his comrades and going off generally in a<br>
blaze of melodramatic fireworks, really made me so unhappy<br>
that I lost my night's rest. So soon as the speech was over<br>
the company was invited into the house to 'pour a libation to<br>
the holy cause'--in the vernacular, to take a drink and spit<br>
on the floor."</blockquote>

Evidently Southern eloquence was not tolerable to the ears of the
British consul. Or was it the din of the church bells rather than
the clamour of the orator, that offended him? (<i>Lyons

not be declared and both at home and abroad his action, and that of
other former anti-slavery leaders, for the moment weakened faith
that the North was in earnest on the general issue of
slavery.</blockquote>

colleagues at Washington. The Russian Minister, Stoeckl, early
declared the Union permanently destroyed, and regretting the fact,
yet hoped the North would soon accept the inevitable and seek close
co-operation with the South in commerce and in foreign relations.
This view was repeated by him many times and most emphatically as
late as the first month of 1863. (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to
F.O., January 29-February 10, 1863. No. 342.) It was not until
September, 1863, that Stoeckl ventured to hope for a Northern
reconquest of the South. I am indebted to Dr. Frank A. Golder, of
Stanford University, for the use of his notes and transcripts
covering all of the Russian diplomatic correspondence with the

way or another. Seward made no reply. (<i>Ibid.</i>, March 25-April

of personal impressions was that made by W.H. Russell and later
printed in his "Diary" but not reproduced in his letters to the

were far exceeded in proportion by his feet.... The impression

kindliness, sagacity, and awkward bonhomie of his face ... eyes
dark, full, and deeply set, are penetrating, but full of an
expression which almost amounts to tenderness.... A person who met
Mr. Lincoln in the street would not take him to be what--according

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POLICY, MAY, 1861</h3>
<br>
<p>In June, 1859, a short-lived Conservative Government under the
leadership of Lord Derby had been replaced by a "coalition" Liberal
Government, at the head of which stood Palmerston, but so
constituted that almost equal influence was attributed to the
Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell. Both men had previously held
the Premiership, and, as they represented different wings of the
Whig-Liberal party, it was prophesied by political wiseacres that
personal friction would soon lead to a new disruption. Nor were the
possible elements of discord confined to these two. Gladstone,
formerly a Peelite Tory, and for a time uncertain whether to return
to the Tory fold or to join the Liberals, had yielded to
Palmerston's promise of a free hand in financial matters, and had
joined the Ministry as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Opposed to him
in a certain sense, as the rival claimant for political leadership
among the younger group, was Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Home
Secretary until July, 1861, thereafter until his death in April,
1863, Secretary for War. Acting in some degree as intermediary and
conciliator between these divergent interests stood Lord Granville,
President of Council, then a "Conservative-Liberal," especially
valuable to the Cabinet for the confidence reposed in him by Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert.</p>
<p>In 1861 Palmerston was seventy-seven years old. Long before this
he had built his popularity upon a vigorous British "patriotism,"
assertive of England's honour and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_77"></a>[V1:pg 77]</span> jealous for British advantage. Now,
however, as head of a Government requiring the most delicate
handling to maintain itself, he devoted his energies to details of
political management in which he had great skill. His ambition was,
primarily, to retain office, and in this purpose he was fortunate
because, unknown to his ministerial colleagues, he had received an
indirect pledge from Lord Derby, the Opposition leader, that there
would be, for a time at least, no determined effort to unseat him
so long as his Ministry brought forward no Bill for a further
expansion of the franchise. In the unwillingness to make any
further adventure toward an expanded democracy Palmerston was
wholly at one with Derby. Of like opinion, though less strongly so,
was Russell, whose popular nickname, "Finality John," gained by his
assertion that the Reform Bill of 1832 was England's last step
toward democracy, sufficiently indicates his stand on the franchise
question. In fact every member of the Cabinet belonged to the
"Conservative-Liberal" group, though with shades of political
faith, and none were really Liberals--far less Radicals. The
outspoken Radicals in Parliament, like John Bright, and his friend
Cobden, who had refused to take office under Palmerston, gave a
lukewarm support to the Ministry, but would not pledge themselves
to steadfast adherence. They had hopes of Gladstone, believed that
he would ultimately come into their group, but meanwhile watched
with anxiety his delighted immersion, as indeed Palmerston desired
it, in the details of financial management to the exclusion of
other questions.</p>
<p>The matter of ministerial and general British attitude toward
democracy as affecting British policy during the American Civil War
will be considered in a later chapter. In the spring of 1861 it had
not become a clear-cut British opinion and did not, so far as
historical evidence can determine, affect early governmental policy
toward America. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"></a>[V1:pg
78]</span> The outstanding feature of the British Government in
1861 is that it was made up of various so-called "Liberal"
elements, the representatives of each of which carried on the
business of his own department much as he pleased. Palmerston's
was, of course, the deciding opinion, whenever he cared to express
it, but this he did but rarely. His great concern was to keep his
all-star associates running smoothly together and thus to give no
occasion for parliamentary criticism and attack. It followed that
Russell, eight years the junior of Palmerston, was in foreign
affairs more powerful and independent than is customary. Indeed the
Government was at times spoken of as the "Palmerston-Russell
Ministry." These two were the leaders of the team; next came
Gladstone and Cornewall Lewis, rivals of the younger generation,
and each eager to lead when their elders should retire from
harness. Gladstone's great ability was already recognized, but his
personal political faith was not yet clear. Lewis, lacking his
rival's magnetic and emotional qualities, cold, scholarly, and
accurate in performance, was regarded as a statesman of high
promise<a name="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127">[127]</a>.
Other Cabinet members, as is the custom of coalitions, were more
free in opinion and action than in a strict party ministry where
one dominating personality imposes his will upon his
colleagues.</p>
<p>Lord John Russell, then, in foreign policy, was more than the
main voice of the Government; rather, save in times of extreme
crisis, governmental foreign policy was Russell's policy. This was
even more true as regards American than European affairs, for the
former were little understood, and dependence was necessarily
placed upon the man whose business it was to be familiar with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"></a>[V1:pg 79]</span>
Indeed there was little actual parliamentary or governmental
interest, before midsummer of 1861, in the American question,
attention in foreign affairs being directed toward Italian
expansion, to the difficulties related to the control of the Ionian
islands, and to the developing Danish troubles in
Schleswig-Holstein. Neither did the opposition party venture to
express a policy as regards America. Lord Derby, able but indolent,
occasionally indulged in caustic criticism, but made no attempt to
push his attack home. Malmesbury, his former Foreign Secretary, was
active and alert in French affairs, but gave no thought to
relations across the Atlantic<a name="FNanchor128"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_128">[128]</a>. Disraeli, Tory leader in the Commons,
skilfully led a strong minority in attacks on the Government's
policy, but never on the American question, though frequently urged
to do so by the friends of the South. In short for the first year
of the Civil War, 1861, the policy of Great Britain toward America
was the policy of Lord John Russell, unhampered by friend or
foe.</p>
<p>This being the case, what did Russell know about the American
crisis? Briefly, no more than has already been stated as derived
from the reports of British officials in the United States, and
from the pages of the public press. The salient facts known to
Russell were few. Lincoln's Cabinet had been named. Lincoln himself
was absolutely an unknown quantity, but it was unbelievable that a
man of his origins and history could be more than a mere
figurehead--an opinion then held as widely in America as in
England. But someone must determine American policy, and by
universal consent, this would be Seward.</p>
<p>The new Secretary of State was at the moment better known in
England than any other American statesman, with the possible
exception of Charles Sumner, whose visits and personal contacts had
established a circle of British <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_80"></a>[V1:pg 80]</span> friendships. Both men were accepted
as champions of anti-slavery, Sumner for his vigorous denunciations
and his so-called "martyrdom" under the physical violence of the
South Carolinan, Brooks; and Seward for his clever political
anti-Southern leadership in the United States Senate. But Seward's
reputation in this respect was offset by the belief that he was
anti-British in his personal sentiments, or at least that he was
very ready to arouse for political ends the customary anti-British
sentiment of his Irish constituents in the State of New York. In
1860, on the occasion of the visit to the United States of the
Prince of Wales, Seward is alleged to have stated to the Duke of
Newcastle that in case he became Secretary of State it would then
"become my duty to insult England, and I mean to do so"--a threat,
whether jocose or not, that aroused much serious and anxious
speculation in British governmental circles<a name=
"FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129">[129]</a>. Moreover
Seward's reputation was that of a wily, clever politician, rather
unscrupulous in methods which British politicians professed to
disdain--a reputation serving to dim somewhat, as indeed it did in
America also, the sincere idealisms and patriotism of the
statesman. Altogether, Seward was regarded in Great Britain as a
rather dangerous man, yet as the inevitable guiding power in the
new Republican administration.</p>
<p>This estimate was shared by many in the United States also, but
not by all. The new American Minister to London, Charles Francis
Adams, himself a most stiffly upright politician, both regarded
Seward as the only possible leader of Republican party policy and
rejoiced that this was so, having great confidence in his chief's
integrity and wisdom. Adams himself was well suited to his new
post. He was known as having early in 1849 fought the battle of
anti-slavery as a "Free Soil Whig," and later as a leading
Republican member of Congress from Massachusetts. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_81"></a>[V1:pg 81]</span> Principally,
however, he was suited to his post by education, family, and
character. He had been taken as a boy to Russia during his father's
ministry at St. Petersburg, and later had been educated in England.
His father and grandfather, John Quincy Adams and John Adams, both
Presidents of the United States, had both, also, been American
Ministers at London. Intensely patriotic, but having wide
acquaintance through training and study with European affairs,
especially those of Britain, and equipped with high intellectual
gifts, Adams was still further fitted to his new post by his power
of cool judgment and careful expression in critical times. His very
coolness, sometimes appearing as coldness and stiff dignity,
rendered him an especially fit agent to deal with Russell, a man of
very similar characteristics. The two men quickly learned to
respect and esteem each other, whatever clash arose in national
policies.</p>
<p>But meanwhile Adams, in April, 1861, was not yet arrived in
London. The Southern Government organized at Montgomery, Alabama,
but soon transferred to Richmond, Virginia, was headed by Jefferson
Davis as President and Alexander Stephens as Vice-President.
Neither man was well known in England, though both had long been
prominent in American politics. The little British information on
Davis, that he had served in the United States Senate and as a
Cabinet member, seemed to indicate that he was better fitted to
executive duties than his rival, Lincoln. But Davis' foreign policy
was wholly a matter for speculation, and his Cabinet consisted of
men absolutely unknown to British statesmen. In truth it was not a
Cabinet of distinction, for it was the misfortune of the South that
everywhere, as the Civil War developed, Southern gentlemen sought
reputation and glory in the army rather than in political position.
Nor did President Davis himself ever fully grasp the importance to
the South of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"></a>[V1:pg
82]</span> well-considered and energetic foreign policy. At first,
indeed, home controversy compelled anxious attention to the
exclusion of other matters. Until war cemented Southern patriotism,
Davis, himself regarded as an extremist, felt it necessary in
denial of an asserted unreasonableness of personal attitude, to
appoint to office men known for their earlier moderate opinions on
both slavery and secession<a name="FNanchor130"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_130">[130]</a>. "The single exception to this general
policy<a name="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131">[131]</a>"
was the appointment as agents to Europe of Yancey, Rost and Mann,
all of them extreme pro-slavery men and eager secessionists. Of
these Mann was the only one with any previous diplomatic
experience. Yancey's choice was particularly inappropriate, for he
at least was known abroad as the extreme fire-eating Southern
orator, demanding for ten years past, that Southern action in
defence of states rights and Southern "interests," which now, at
last, the South was attempting<a name="FNanchor132"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_132">[132]</a>.</p>
<p>Yancey and Rost, starting on their journey on March 16, reached
London on April 29<a name="FNanchor133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133">[133]</a>. Meanwhile in this same month of April,
conditions in America, so long confused and uncertain, were being
rapidly clarified. The South, earlier than the North, had come to a
determined policy, for while during January and February, at the
Montgomery convention, there had been uncertainty as to actively
applying the doctrinaire right of secession, by March the party of
action had triumphed, and though there was still talk of
conferences with the North, and commissioners actually appointed,
no real expectation existed of a favourable result. In the North,
the determination of policy was more slowly developed. Lincoln was
not inaugurated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"></a>[V1:pg
83]</span> until March 4, and no positive pronouncement was earlier
possible. Even after that date uncertainty still prevailed.
European correspondents were reporting men like Sumner as willing
to let the South go in peace. The Mayor of New York City was
discussing the advisability of a separate secession by that
financial centre from Nation and State alike--and of setting up as
a "free town." Seward, just appointed Secretary of State, was
repudiating in both official and private talk any intention to
coerce the South by force of arms<a name="FNanchor134"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_134">[134]</a>. It is no wonder that British statesmen
were largely at sea over the American situation.</p>
<p>But on April 13, 1861, the Stars and Stripes floating over Fort
Sumter in Charleston harbour was lowered in surrender of a Federal
fortress under the armed attack of the newly-born Confederacy. That
event drove away as by magic the uncertainty of the North, and
removed the last vestiges of Southern doubt. A great wave of
militant patriotism swept over both sections<a name=
"FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135">[135]</a>. Hurriedly both
North and South prepared for war, issuing calls for volunteers and
organizing in all accustomed warlike preparations. The news of
Sumter reached London on April 27, and that civil war seemed
certain was known on April 29. On April 17, Davis, since the South
lacked a navy, approved a proclamation offering to issue letters of
marque and reprisal. On April 19 Lincoln proclaimed a Northern
intention to treat as pirates any privateers acting under such
letters, and also gave notice of a blockade of Southern ports, to
be instituted later. Thus suddenly, so it seemed to British
officials and public after the long delay and uncertainty of
months, events in America had precipitated a state of war, though
in fact there were still to elapse other months in which both North
and South laboured to transform <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_84"></a>[V1:pg 84]</span> a peaceful society into one capable
of waging effective battle.</p>
<p>The result of this sudden change in the American horizon was to
alter, almost as quickly, the previous delay in outlining a British
policy, though, presumably, the British Government, while waiting
the turn of events, had given careful consideration to the steps
required of it in just such a situation as had now arisen.
Certainly both Lyons and Russell had been deeply anxious for some
time, and had visualized a proper British policy. The movement in
Great Britain now became rapid. On April 29, Malmesbury, in the
Lords, spoke of the news of civil war which had arrived "this
morning," and asked if the Government had tried to prevent it, or
had set on foot negotiations with other powers to check it.
Wodehouse, replying for the Government, stated that the United
States as an independent State would have resented any suggestions
from Great Britain, and that Lyons had been instructed to be
extremely careful about offering advice unless "asked for by the
contending parties themselves." Both speakers commented on the
"ties of blood" rendering Britain especially anxious in this
American quarrel, and regretted the conflict<a name=
"FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136">[136]</a>. Malmesbury's
query as to the approach to another government, meaning France, was
evaded. That some such approach, in accordance with the earlier
advice of Lyons<a name="FNanchor137"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_137">[137]</a>, had already been made, is evident from
the fact that three days later, on May 1, Dallas learned from
Russell of the plan of joint action with France, though what that
action would be was not made clear<a name=
"FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138">[138]</a>. As Dallas'
report was soon the basis of an American complaint shortly to be
considered, the paragraph referring to this matter is
important:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"></a>[V1:pg 85]</span>
<blockquote>"The solicitude felt by Lord John Russell as to the
effect of certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by
the President induced him to request me to call at his private
residence yesterday. I did so. He told me that the three
representatives of the Southern confederacy were here<a name=
"FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139">[139]</a>; that he had
not seen them, but was not unwilling to do so, <i>unofficially</i>;
that there existed an understanding between this government and
that of France which would lead both to take the same course as to
recognition, whatever that course might be; and he then referred to
the rumour of a meditated blockade of Southern ports and their
discontinuance as ports of entry--topics on which I had heard
nothing. But as I informed him that Mr. Adams had apprised me of
his intention to be on his way hither, in the steamship 'Niagara,'
which left Boston on the 1st May, and that he would probably arrive
in less than two weeks, by the 12th or 15th instant, his lordship
acquiesced in the expediency of disregarding mere rumour, and
waiting the full knowledge to be brought by my successor. The
motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be further postponed, at his
lordship's suggestion."</blockquote>
<p>May 3rd, Russell held an unofficial interview with the two
Southern commissioners in fact arrived, Yancey and Rost. As
reported by them<a name="FNanchor140"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_140">[140]</a>, Russell listened with attention to their
representation, but made no informing comment. They argued the
constitutional right of secession, depicted the firm determination
of the South, were confident of early acquiescence by the North,
and especially laid stress on the Southern desire for free trade.
Russell's own report to Lyons on this interview and on one held six
days later, May 9, is in substantial agreement, but much more is
made by him than by the Commissioners of a question put by Russell
as to a Southern plan of reviving the African slave-trade<a name=
"FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141">[141]</a>. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_86"></a>[V1:pg 86]</span> Yancey and Rost
denied this and asserted "that they had prohibited the slave-trade,
and did not mean to revive it." Their report to Richmond does not
depict this matter as of special significance in the interview;
Russell's report to Lyons lays stress upon it. The general result
of the interview was that Russell listened, but refused, as to
Dallas, to make any pledge on recognition. But the Southern
Commissioners came away with a feeling of confidence and were
content to wait on British action<a name="FNanchor142"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_142">[142]</a>.</p>
<p>On this same day, May 3, Russell received from the
Attorney-General a memorandum in reply to a query as to recognizing
the belligerency of the South and as to the right of the South to
issue letters of marque and reprisal. The memorandum notes that
Southern privateering would be dangerous to British commerce with
the North, but sees no help for it. "The best solution," wrote the
Attorney-General, "would be for the European nations to determine
that the war between the two Confederacies shall be carried on on
the principles of 'Justum Bellum,' and shall be conducted according
to the rules of the Treaty of Paris. Recognize the Southern States
as a Belligerent on this condition only<a name=
"FNanchor143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143">[143]</a>." The next day,
referring to this memorandum, Russell wrote Lyons that the law
officers "are of opinion that we must consider the Civil War in
America as regular war<a name="FNanchor144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144">[144]</a>," but he does <i>not</i> comment on the
legal advice to press the South to abandon privateering before
recognizing her belligerent rights, for this is the only meaning
that can be attached to the last sentence quoted <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_87"></a>[V1:pg 87]</span> from the
Attorney-General's memorandum. This advice, however, in view of the
opinion that there was "no help for it," was presumably but a
suggestion as to a possible diplomatic manoeuvre with little
confidence that it would succeed. The "best solution" was not the
probable one, for the South, without a navy, would not readily
yield its only naval weapon.</p>
<p>In these few days British policy was rapidly matured and
announced. The letter of May 4 to Lyons, stating the Civil War to
be a "regular war" was followed on May 6 by a formal instruction
giving Lyons advance notice of the determination reached by the
Cabinet to recognize the belligerent rights of the South. Russell
indulged in many expressions of regret and sympathy, but Lyons was
not to conceal that this British action represented the
Government's view of the actualities of the American situation. Yet
while Lyons was not to conceal this opinion he was not instructed
to notify Seward, officially, of the recognition of Southern
belligerency<a name="FNanchor145"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_145">[145]</a>. Here was a correct understanding of the
difficulty of the diplomatic position at Washington, and a
permitted avoidance by Lyons of dangerous ground<a name=
"FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146">[146]</a>. Russell was
not then aware of the tenacity with which Seward was to cling to a
theory, not yet clearly formulated for foreign governments, that
the Civil War was a rebellion of peoples rather than a conflict of
governments, but he does appear to have understood the delicacy of
formal notification to the constituted government at
Washington<a name="FNanchor147"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_147">[147]</a>. Moreover his instructions were in line
with the British policy of refusing, at present, a recognition of
Southern sovereignty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"></a>[V1:pg 88]</span>
<p>On the same day, May 6, a copy of the instructions to Lyons was
sent to Cowley, British Ambassador at Paris, directing him to
request France to join, promptly, in recognizing Southern
belligerent rights. Cowley was also instructed that the blockade
and privateering required precautions by European governments, and
it was suggested that France and England unite in requesting both
belligerents to accede to the second and third articles of the
Declaration of Paris<a name="FNanchor148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_148">[148]</a>. These articles refer to the exemption
from capture, except contraband, of enemy's goods under a neutral
flag, and of neutral goods under an enemy's flag<a name=
"FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149">[149]</a>. This day,
also, Russell stated in Parliament that England was about to
recognize the belligerent rights of the South, and spoke of the
measure as a necessary and inevitable one. May 7, Cowley notified
Russell that Thouvenel, the French Foreign Minister, was in
complete agreement with England's policy<a name=
"FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150">[150]</a>, and on May 9,
in a more extended communication, Cowley sent word of Thouvenel's
suggestion that both powers issue a declaration that they "intended
to abstain from all interference," and that M. de Flahault, French
Ambassador at London, had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_89"></a>[V1:pg 89]</span> been given instructions to act in
close harmony with Russell<a name="FNanchor151"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_151">[151]</a>.</p>
<p>The rapidity of movement in formulating policy in the six days
from May 1 to May 6, seems to have taken the British public and
press somewhat by surprise, for there is a lack of newspaper
comment even after Russell's parliamentary announcement of policy
on the last-named date. But on May 9 the <i>Times</i> set the
fashion of general approval in an editorial stating that Great
Britain was now coming to see the American conflict in a new
light--as a conflict where there were in fact no such ideals
involved as had been earlier attributed to it. Southern rights were
now more clearly understood, and in any case since war, though
greatly to be regretted, was now at hand, it was England's business
to keep strictly out of it and to maintain neutrality<a name=
"FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152">[152]</a>. This
generalization was no doubt satisfactory to the public, but in the
Government and in Parliament men who were thinking seriously of
specific difficulties realized that the two main problems
immediately confronting a British neutral policy were privateering
and blockade. The South had declared its <i>intention</i> to use
privateers. The North had declared its <i>intention</i>, first to
hang those who engaged in privateering, and second to establish a
blockade. Neither declaration had as yet been put into effect.</p>
<p>The first action of the British Government was directed toward
privateering. On May 1, Russell sent a note to the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty calling attention to the Southern
plan to issue letters of marque and reprisal and directing that
reinforcements be sent to the British fleet in American waters.
This was prompt action on unofficial information, for Davis'
proclamation bore date of April 17, and Lyons' despatch containing
copies of it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"></a>[V1:pg
90]</span> sent on April 22, was not received by Russell until May
10<a name="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153">[153]</a>.
Ordinary news from the United States required ten days to get into
print in London<a name="FNanchor154"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_154">[154]</a>, but official messages might be sent more
rapidly by way of telegraph to Halifax, thence by steamer to
Liverpool and by telegraph again to London. In case the telegram to
Halifax coincided with the departure of a fast vessel the time was
occasionally reduced to seven days, but never less. At the best the
exact information as to the contents of the Davis and Lincoln
proclamations of April 17 and 19 respectively, could have been
received only a few days before the order was issued to reinforce
the British fleet.</p>

<b>SIR WILLIAM GREGORY, K.C.M.G.</b><br>
(<i>From Lady Gregory's "Sir William Gregory, K.C.M.G.: An
Autobiography," by kind permission</i>)</p>
<br>
<p>The next day, May 2, Ewart, in the Commons, asked "if Privateers
sailing under the flag of an unrecognized Power will be dealt with
as Pirates," thus showing the immediate parliamentary concern at
the Davis and Lincoln proclamations. Russell stated in reply that a
British fleet had been sent to protect British interests and took
occasion to indicate British policy by adding, "we have not been
involved in any way in that contest by any act or giving any advice
in the matter, and, for God's sake, let us if possible keep out of
it<a name="FNanchor155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155">[155]</a>." May
6, Gregory, a friend of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_91"></a>[V1:pg 91]</span> South, who had already given notice
of a motion for the recognition of the Confederacy as an
independent State, asked whether the United States had been
informed that a blockade of Southern ports would not be recognized
unless effective, and whether there would be acquiescence in the
belligerent right of the South to issue letters of marque and
reprisal<a name="FNanchor156"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_156">[156]</a>. Russell replied that Lincoln had
<i>not</i> been informed that a blockade must be effective to be
respected since the Washington Government did not need to be told
of an international rule which it had itself long proclaimed. As to
the second point, he now announced what heretofore had not been
clearly stated, that Southern privateers could not be regarded by
Great Britain as pirates, for if so regarded Britain would herself
have to treat them as pirates and would thus be unneutral. This was
in fact, in spite of Northern bitter accusations that Britain was
exhibiting governmental sympathy with the South by her tolerance of
the plan of Southern privateering, an inescapable conclusion.
Russell added, however, that the matter of privateering involved
some new questions under the Declaration of Paris upon which the
Government had not yet decided what stand to take<a name=
"FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157">[157]</a>. It was on this
same day, in fact, that Russell had instructed Cowley to take up
with France the question of the Declaration of Paris<a name=
"FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158">[158]</a>, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_92"></a>[V1:pg 92]</span> Privateering and
blockade, declared in America months before there was any
possibility of putting them into effect, and months before there
were any military operations in the field, forced this rapid
European action, especially the action of Great Britain, which,
more than any other European nation, feared belligerent
interference with her carrying and export trade. How was the
British Government to know that Davis would not bend every energy
in sending out privateers, and Lincoln to establish a blockade? The
respective declarations of Davis and Lincoln were the <i>first</i>
evidences offered of belligerent status. It was reasonable to
assume that here would come the first energetic efforts of the
belligerents. Nor was British governmental intelligence
sufficiently informed to be aware that Davis, in fact, controlled
few ships that could be fitted out as privateers, or that
two-thirds of the Northern navy was at the moment widely scattered
in foreign seas, making impossible a prompt blockade.</p>
<p>To the British view the immediate danger to its commercial
interests lay in this announced maritime war, and it felt the
necessity of defining its neutral position with speed. The
underlying fact of the fixity of Southern <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_93"></a>[V1:pg 93]</span> determination to
maintain secession had in the last few weeks become clearly
recognized.</p>
<p>Moreover the latest information sent by British officials in
America, some of it received just before the issue of the
Proclamation of Neutrality, some just after, was all confirmative
of the rapid approach of a great war. A letter from Bunch, at
Charleston, was received on May 10, depicting the united Southern
will to resist Northern attack, and asserting that the South had no
purpose save to conduct a strictly defensive war. Bunch was no
longer caustic; he now felt that a new nation was in process of
birth<a name="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159">[159]</a>.
May 4, Monson, writing from Washington, and just returned from a
trip through the South, in the course of which he had visited
Montgomery, stated "<i>no reconstruction</i> of the Union is
possible," and added that there was no danger of a servile
insurrection, a matter that now somewhat began to disturb the
British Government and public<a name="FNanchor160"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_160">[160]</a>. A few days later on, May 12, Lyons
expressed his strong sympathy with the North for reasons of
anti-slavery, law, and race, but added that he shrank from
expressions of sympathy for fear of thus encouraging the Northern
Cabinet in its plan of prosecuting civil war since such a war would
be frightful in its consequences both to America and to
England<a name="FNanchor161"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_161">[161]</a>.</p>
<p>Such reports if received before the issue of the Proclamation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94"></a>[V1:pg 94]</span> of
Neutrality must have strengthened the feeling that prompt action
was necessary; if received later, they gave confidence that that
action had been wise. May 9, Forster asked in the Commons a series
of questions as to the application of the British Foreign
Enlistment Act in the American crisis. What would be the status of
British citizens serving on Confederate privateers? How would the
Government treat citizens who aided in equipping such privateers?
Did not the Government intend to take measures to prevent the
infringement of law in British ports? Here was pressure by a friend
of the North to hasten an official announcement of the policy
already notified to Parliament. Sir George Lewis replied stating
that the Government was about to issue a general proclamation
warning British subjects not to take any part in the war<a name=
"FNanchor162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162">[162]</a>. Similar
questions were asked by Derby in the Lords on May 10, and received
a similar answer<a name="FNanchor163"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_163">[163]</a>. The few days' delay following Russell's
statement of May 6 was due to consideration given by the Law
Officers to the exact form required. The Proclamation as issued was
dated May 13, and was officially printed in the <i>London
Gazette</i> on May 14.</p>
<p>In form and in substance the Proclamation of Neutrality did not
differ from customary usage<a name="FNanchor164"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_164">[164]</a>. It spoke of the Confederacy as "states
styling themselves the Confederate States of America," prohibited
to Englishmen enlistment on either side, or efforts to enlist
others, or equipment of ships of war, or delivery of commissions to
such ships. War vessels being equipped in British ports would be
seized and forfeited to the British Government. If a belligerent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"></a>[V1:pg 95]</span>
war-ship came into a British port, no change or increase of
equipment was to be permitted. If a subject violated the
Proclamation he was both punishable in British courts and forfeited
any claim to British protection. The Parliamentary discussion on
May 16 brought out more clearly and in general unanimity of opinion
the policy of the Government in application of the Proclamation;
the South was definitely recognized as a belligerent, but
recognition of independence was for the future to determine; the
right of the South to send out privateers was regretfully
recognized; such privateers could not be regarded as pirates and
the North would have no right to treat them as such, but if the
North in defiance of international opinion did so treat them, Great
Britain had at least warned its subjects that they, if engaged in
service on a Southern privateer, had no claim to British
protection; a blockade of the South to be respected must be
effective at least to the point where a vessel attempting to pass
through was likely to be captured; the plan of blockading the
entire Southern coast, with its three thousand miles of coast line,
was on the face of it ridiculous--evidence that Members of
Parliament were profoundly ignorant of the physical geography of
the Southern seaboard<a name="FNanchor165"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_165">[165]</a>.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary discussion did not reveal any partiality for
one side in the American quarrel above the other. It turned wholly
on legal questions and their probable application. On May 15
Russell sent to Lyons the official text of the Proclamation, but
did not instruct him to communicate it officially to Seward,
leaving this rather to Lyons' discretion. This was discretionary in
diplomatic usage since in strict fact the Proclamation was
addressed to British subjects and need not be communicated
officially to the belligerents. In the result the discretion
permitted to Lyons had, an important bearing, for recognition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96"></a>[V1:pg 96]</span>
Southern belligerency was opposed to the theory upon which the
Northern Government was attempting to proceed. Lyons did not then,
or later, make official communication to Seward of the
Proclamation<a name="FNanchor166"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_166">[166]</a>. The fact soon appeared that the United
States seriously objected to the Proclamation of Neutrality,
protesting first, its having been issued at all, and, in the second
place, resenting what was considered its "premature" announcement
by a friendly nation. This matter developed so serious a criticism
by both American Government and public, both during and after the
Civil War, that it requires a close examination. Did the British
Government exhibit an unfriendly attitude toward the North by a
"premature" Proclamation of Neutrality?</p>
<p>On May 13 the new American Minister landed at Liverpool, and on
the morning of the fourteenth he was "ready for business" in
London<a name="FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167">[167]</a>,
but the interview with Russell arranged for that day by Dallas was
prevented by the illness of Russell's brother, the Duke of
Bedford<a name="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168">[168]</a>.
All that was immediately possible was to make official notification
of arrival and to secure the customary audience with the Queen.
This was promptly arranged, and on May 16 Adams was presented,
Palmerston attending in the enforced absence of Russell. Adams'
first report to Seward was therefore brief, merely noting that
public opinion was "not exactly what we would wish." In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"></a>[V1:pg 97]</span> he
referred to the utterances of the press, particularly those of the
<i>Times</i>, which from day to day and with increasing vigour
sounded the note of strict neutrality in a "non-idealistic" war. On
May 30 the <i>Times</i>, asserting that both parties in America
were bidding for English support, summed up public opinion as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"We have been told, in fact, by Northern politicians,
that it does not become us to be indifferent, and by Southern
leaders that they are half inclined to become British once more.
Both sides are bidding for us, and both sides have their partisans
over here. On such perilous ground we cannot walk too warily.<br>
<br>
"For our own part, we are free to confess that the march of events
has induced us to regard the dispute as a more commonplace kind of
quarrel than it at first appeared to be. The real motives of the
belligerents, as the truth transpires; appear to be exactly such
motives as have caused wars in all times and countries. They are
essentially selfish motives--that is to say, they are based upon
speculations of national power, territorial aggrandizement,
political advantage, and commercial gain. Neither side can claim
any superiority of principle, or any peculiar purity of
patriotism....<br>
<br>
"We certainly cannot discover in these arguments anything to remove
the case from the common category of national or monarchical
quarrels. The representations of the North might be made word for
word by any autocrat or conqueror desirous of 'rectifying' his
frontier, consolidating his empire, or retaining a disaffected
province in subjection. The manifestos of the South might be put
forth by any State desirous of terminating an unpleasant connexion
or exchanging union for independence....<br>
<br>
"It is just such a question as has been left times out of mind in
this Old World to the decision of the sword. The sword will be the
arbitrator in the New World too; but the event teaches us plainly
enough that Republics and Democracies enjoy no exemption from the
passions and follies of humanity."</blockquote>
<p>Under these impressions Adams presented himself <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_98"></a>[V1:pg 98]</span> on May 18 for his
first interview with Russell<a name="FNanchor169"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_169">[169]</a>. He stated that he had come with the idea
that there was</p>
<blockquote>".... little to do beyond the duty of preserving the
relations actually existing between the two nations from the risk
of being unfavourably affected by the unfortunate domestic
disturbances prevailing in my own country. It was not without pain
that I was compelled to admit that from the day of my arrival I had
felt in the proceedings of both houses of Parliament, in the
language of Her Majesty's ministers, and in the tone of opinion
prevailing in private circles, more of uncertainty about this than
I had before thought possible,"</blockquote>
<p>Adams then inquired whether the replies given by Russell to
Dallas refusing to indicate a policy as to recognition of the South
implied a British purpose "to adopt a policy which would have the
effect to widen, if not to make irreparable, a breach [between
North and South] which we believed yet to be entirely manageable by
ourselves."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"></a>[V1:pg 99]</span>
<p>Russell here replied that "there was no such intention"; he had
simply meant to say to Dallas that the British Government "were not
disposed in any way to interfere." To this Adams answered that:</p>
<blockquote>".... it was deserving of grave consideration whether
great caution was not to be used in adopting any course that might,
even in the most indirect way, have an effect to encourage the
hopes of the disaffected in America.... It was in this view that I
must be permitted to express the great regret I had felt on
learning the decision to issue the Queen's proclamation, which at
once raised the insurgents to the level of a belligerent State, and
still more the language used in regard to it by Her Majesty's
ministers in both houses of Parliament before and since. Whatever
might be the design, there could be no shadow of doubt that the
effect of these events had been to encourage the friends of the
disaffected here. The tone of the press and of private opinion
indicated it strongly."</blockquote>
<p>Russell's answer was that Adams was placing more stress on
recent events than they deserved. The Government had taken the
advice of the Law Officers and as a result had concluded that "as a
question merely of <i>fact</i>, a war existed.... Under such
circumstances</p>
<blockquote>it seemed scarcely possible to avoid speaking of this
in the technical sense as <i>justum bellum</i>, that is, a war of
two sides, without in any way implying an opinion of its justice,
as well as to withhold an endeavour, so far as possible, to bring
the management of it within the rules of modern civilized warfare.
This was all that was contemplated by the Queen's proclamation. It
was designed to show the purport of existing laws, and to explain
to British subjects their liabilities in case they should engage in
the war."</blockquote>
<p>To this Adams answered "... that under other circumstances</p>
<blockquote>I should be very ready to give my cheerful assent to
this view of his lordship's. But I must be permitted frankly to
remark that the action taken seemed, at least to my mind, a little
more rapid than was absolutely called for by the occasion.... And
furthermore, it pronounced the insurgents to be a belligerent State
before they had ever shown their capacity to maintain any kind of
warfare whatever, except within one of their own harbours, and
under every possible advantage. It considered them a marine power
before they had ever exhibited a single privateer on the ocean....
The rule was very clear, that whenever it became apparent that any
organized form of society had advanced so far as to prove its power
to defend and protect itself against the assaults of enemies, and
at the same time to manifest a capacity to maintain binding
relations with foreign nations, then a measure of recognition could
not be justly objected to on any side. The case was very different
when such an interference should take place, prior to the
establishment of the proof required, as to bring about a result
which would not probably have happened but for that external
agency."</blockquote>
<p>This representation by the American Minister, thus <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_100"></a>[V1:pg 100]</span> early made,
contains the whole argument advanced against the British
Proclamation of Neutrality, though there were many similar
representations made at greater length both by Adams later, and by
Seward at Washington. They are all well summarized by Bernard as "a
rejection ... of the proposition that the existence of war is a
simple matter of fact, to be ascertained as other facts are--and an
assertion ... of the dogma that there can be no war, so far as
foreign nations are concerned, and, therefore, no neutrality, so
long as there is a sovereignty <i>de jure</i><a name=
"FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170">[170]</a>." But in this
first representation Adams, in the main, laid stress upon the
<i>haste</i> with which the Proclamation of Neutrality had been
issued, and, by inference, upon the evidence that British
sympathies were with the South.</p>
<p>One British journal was, indeed, at this very moment voicing
exactly those opinions advanced by Adams. The <i>Spectator</i>
declared that while the Proclamation, on the face of it, appeared
to be one of strict neutrality, it in reality tended "directly to
the benefit of the South<a name="FNanchor171"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_171">[171]</a>." A fortnight later this paper asserted,
"The quarrel, cover it with cotton as we may, is between freedom
and slavery, right and wrong, the dominion of God and the dominion
of the Devil, and the duty of England, we submit, is clear." She
should, even though forced to declare her neutrality, refuse for
all time to recognize the slave-holding Confederacy<a name=
"FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172">[172]</a>. But the
<i>Spectator</i> stood nearly alone in this view. The <i>Saturday
Review</i> defended in every respect the issue of the Proclamation
and added, "In a short time, it will be necessary further to
recognize the legitimacy of the Southern Government; but the United
States have a right to require that the acknowledgment shall be
postponed until the failure of the effort <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_101"></a>[V1:pg 101]</span> which they
assert or believe that they are about to make has resulted in an
experimental proof that subjugation is impossible<a name=
"FNanchor173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173">[173]</a>." A few
provincial papers supported the view of the <i>Spectator</i>, but
they were of minor importance, and generally the press heartily
approved the Proclamation.</p>
<p>At the time of Adams' interview with Russell on May 18 he has
just received an instruction from Seward written under the
impression aroused by Dallas' report of Russell's refusal on April
8 to make any pledge as to British policy on the recognition of
Southern independence. Seward was very much disturbed by what
Russell had said to Dallas. In this instruction, dated April
27<a name="FNanchor174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174">[174]</a>, he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"When you shall have read the instructions at large
which have been sent to you, you will hardly need to be told that
these last remarks of his lordship are by no means satisfactory to
this government. Her Britannic Majesty's government is at liberty
to choose whether it will retain the friendship of this government
by refusing all aid and comfort to its enemies, now in flagrant
rebellion against it, as we think the treaties existing between the
two countries require, or whether the government of Her Majesty
will take the precarious benefits of a different course.<br>
<br>
<p>"You will lose no time in making known to Her Britannic
Majesty's Government that the President regards the answer of his
lordship as possibly indicating a policy that this government would
be obliged to deem injurious to its rights and derogating from its
dignity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having promptly carried out these instructions, as he understood
them, Adams soon began to report an improved British attitude, and
especially in the Government, stating that this improvement was
due, in part, to the vigour now being shown by the Northern
Government, in part "to a sense that the preceding action of Her
Majesty's ministers has been construed to mean more than they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"></a>[V1:pg 102]</span>
intended by it<a name="FNanchor175"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_175">[175]</a>." But at Washington the American
irritation was not so easily allayed. Lyons was reporting Seward
and, indeed, the whole North, as very angry with the Proclamation
of Neutrality<a name="FNanchor176"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_176">[176]</a>. On June 14, Lyons had a long
conversation with Seward in which the latter stubbornly denied that
the South could possess any belligerent rights. Lyons left the
conference feeling that Seward was trying to divide France and
England on this point, and Lyons was himself somewhat anxious
because France was so long delaying her own Proclamation<a name=
"FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177">[177]</a>. To meet the
situation, he and Mercier, the French Minister, went the next day,
June 15, on an official visit to Seward with the intention of
formally presenting the British Proclamation and Thouvenel's
instructions to Mercier to support it<a name=
"FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178">[178]</a>. But Seward
"said at once that he could not receive from us a communication
founded on the assumption that</p>
<blockquote>the Southern Rebels were to be regarded as
Belligerents; that this was a determination to which the Cabinet
had come deliberately; that he could not admit that recent events
had in any respect altered the relations between Foreign Powers and
the Southern States; that he would not discuss the question with
us, but that he should give instructions to the United States
Ministers in London and Paris who would thus be enabled to state
the reasons for the course taken by their Government to Your
Lordship and to M. Thouvenel, if you should be desirous to hear
them.... He should not take Official cognizance of the recognition
of the Belligerent Rights of Southern Rebels by Great Britain and
France, unless he should be forced to do so by an Official
communication addressed to the Government of the United States
itself."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"></a>[V1:pg 103]</span>
<p>In the result the two Ministers submitted their papers to Seward
"for his own use only." They did not regard the moment well chosen
"to be punctilious." Lyons reported that Seward's language and
demeanour throughout the interview were "calm, friendly, and good
humoured," but the fact remained that the United States had not
been officially notified of the Proclamation of Neutrality, and
that the American Government, sensitive to popular excitement in
the matter and committed to the theory of a rebellion of peoples,
was thus left free to continue argument in London without any
necessity of making formal protest and of taking active steps to
support such protest<a name="FNanchor179"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_179">[179]</a>. The official relation was eased by the
conciliatory acquiescence of Lyons. The public anger of America,
expressed in her newspapers, astonished the British press and,
temporarily, made them more careful in comment on American affairs.
The <i>Times</i> told its readers to keep cool. "It is plain that
the utmost care and circumspection must be used by every man or
party in England to avoid giving offence to either of the two
incensed belligerents<a name="FNanchor180"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_180">[180]</a>." In answer to the Northern outcry at the
lack of British sympathy, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_104"></a>[V1:pg 104]</span> it declared "Neutrality--strict
neutrality--is all that the United States Government can
claim<a name="FNanchor181"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_181">[181]</a>."</p>
<p>While the burden of American criticism was thus directed toward
the British recognition of Southern belligerency, there were two
other matters of great moment to the American view--the attitude of
the British Government toward Southern privateers, and the hearing
given by Russell to the Confederate envoys. On the former, Seward,
on May 21, wrote to Adams: "As to the treatment of privateers in
the insurgent service, you will say that this is a question
exclusively our own. We treat them as pirates. They are our own
citizens, or persons employed by our own citizens, preying on the
commerce of our country. If Great Britain shall choose to recognize
them as lawful belligerents and give them shelter from our pursuit
and punishment, the law of nations affords an adequate and proper
remedy<a name="FNanchor182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182">[182]</a>."
This was threatening language, but was for Adams' own eye, and in
the next sentence of his letter Seward stated that avoidance of
friction on this point was easy, since in 1856 Great Britain had
invited the United States to adhere to the Declaration of Paris
everywhere abolishing privateering, and to this the United States
was now ready to accede.</p>
<p>What Seward really meant to accomplish by this was not made
clear for the question of privateering did not constitute the main
point of his belligerent letter of May 21. In fact the proposed
treatment of privateers as pirates might have resulted in very
serious complications, for though the Proclamation of Neutrality
had warned British subjects that they would forfeit any claim to
protection if they engaged in the conflict, it is obvious that the
hanging as a pirate of a British seaman would have aroused a
national outcry almost certain to have forced the Government into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105"></a>[V1:pg 105]</span>
protest and action against America. Fortunately the cooler judgment
of the United States soon led to quiet abandonment of the plan of
treating privateers as pirates, while on the other point of giving
"shelter" to Confederate privateers Seward himself received from
Lyons assurance, even before Adams had made a protest, that no such
shelter would be available in British ports<a name=
"FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183">[183]</a>.</p>
<p>In this same letter of May 21 Seward, writing of the rumour that
the Southern envoys were to be received by Russell "unofficially,"
instructed Adams that he must use efforts to stop this and that:
"You will, in any event, desist from all intercourse whatever,
unofficial as well as official, with the British Government, so
long as it shall continue intercourse of either kind with the
domestic enemies of this country." Here was a positive instruction
as to the American Minister's conduct in a given situation, and a
very serious instruction, nearly equivalent to "taking leave" after
a rupture of diplomatic relations, but the method to be used in
avoiding if possible the necessity of the serious step was left to
Adams' discretion. Well might Adams' comment, when reporting the
outcome, that this was the "most delicate portion of my
task<a name="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184">[184]</a>."
Adams again went over with Russell the suspicion as to British
intentions aroused in America by the Queen's Proclamation, but
added that he had not been able to convince himself of the
existence of an unfriendly design. "But it was not to be disguised
that the fact of the continued stay of the pseudo-commissioners in
this city, and still more the knowledge that they had been admitted
to more or less interviews with his lordship, was calculated to
excite uneasiness. Indeed, it had already given great
dissatisfaction to my <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_106"></a>[V1:pg 106]</span> Government. I added, as
moderately as I could, that in all frankness any further
protraction of this relation could scarcely fail to be viewed by us
as hostile in spirit, and to require some corresponding action
accordingly." Russell replied that both France and England had long
been accustomed to receive such persons unofficially, as in the
case of "Poles, Hungarians, Italians, etc.," to hear what they had
to say. "But this did not imply recognition in their case any more
than in ours. He added that he had seen the gentlemen once some
time ago, and once more some time since; he had no expectation of
seeing them any more<a name="FNanchor185"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_185">[185]</a>."</p>
<p>For the moment, then, a matter which under Seward's instructions
might have brought on a serious crisis was averted by the tact of
Adams and the acquiescence of Russell. Yet no pledge had been
given; Russell merely stated that he had "no expectation" of
further interviews with the Southern commissioners; he was still
ready to hear from them in writing. This caused a division of
opinion between the commissioners; Yancey argued that Russell's
concession to Adams was itself a violation of the neutrality the
British Government had announced, and that it should be met by a
formal protest. But the other members insisted on a reference to
Richmond for instructions<a name="FNanchor186"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_186">[186]</a>. On the same day that Adams reported the
result to Seward he wrote privately to his son in Boston:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107"></a>[V1:pg 107]</span>
<blockquote>"My position here thus far has not been difficult or
painful. If I had followed the course of some of my colleagues in
the diplomatic line, this country might have been on the high road
to the confederate camp before now. It did not seem to me to be
expedient so to play into the hands of our opponents. Although
there has been and is more or less of sympathy with the
slave-holders in certain circles, they are not so powerful as to
overbear the general sentiment of the people. The ministry has been
placed in rather delicate circumstances, when a small loss of power
on either extreme would have thrown them out<a name=
"FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187">[187]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In Adams' opinion the Liberals were on the whole more friendly,
at least, to the North than were the Conservatives, and he
therefore considered it best not to press too harshly upon the
Government.</p>
<p>But the concluding sentence of this same letter was significant:
"I wait with patience--but as yet I have not gone so far as to
engage a house for more than a month at a time...." He might
himself be inclined to view more leniently the Proclamation of
Neutrality and be able to find excuses for the alleged haste with
which it had been issued, but his instructions required strong
representations, especially on the latter point. Adams' report to
Seward of June 14, just noted, on the interview with Russell of
June 12, after treating of privateering and the Southern
commissioners, turns in greater length to the alleged pledge of
delay given by Russell to Dallas, and to the violation of that
pledge in a hasty issue of the Proclamation. He renews attack on
the line already taken on May 18<a name="FNanchor188"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_188">[188]</a>. From this time on, throughout and after
the war, this criticism was repeatedly made and with increasing
bitterness. British friends of the North joined in the American
outcry. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"></a>[V1:pg
108]</span> By mere reiteration it became in the popular mind on
both sides of the Atlantic an accepted and well-founded evidence of
British governmental unfriendliness in May, 1861. At the conclusion
of the Civil War, John Bright in Parliament, commenting on the
causes of American ill-will, declared that the Government of 1861,
knowing that Adams was on his way, should in mere courtesy, have
waited his arrival. Then, said Bright, the Proclamation, entirely
justifiable in itself, might have been issued without offence and
without embittering the United States<a name=
"FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189">[189]</a>.</p>
<p>Had in fact a "pledge to wait" been given to Dallas; and was the
Proclamation hasty and premature? Russell always denied he had
given any such pledge, and the text of Dallas' report of the
interview of May 1 would seem to support that denial<a name=
"FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190">[190]</a>. On that day
Russell for the second time told Dallas that England would not
commit herself, as yet, as regards Southern recognition, clearly
meaning a recognition of <i>sovereignty</i>, not of belligerency,
and immediately asked Dallas what the rumours of a blockade meant.
Dallas replied that he had no information on this point, and
Russell "acquiesced in the expediency of disregarding mere rumour,
and waiting the full knowledge to be brought by my successor. The
motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be further postponed, at his
lordship's suggestion."</p>
<p>The unprejudiced interpretation of this report is merely that
Russell refrained from pressing Dallas about a matter--blockade--of
which Dallas knew nothing, agreeing that this would be explained by
Adams, and especially that he let Dallas understand that Gregory's
motion, which was one for <i>recognizing the independence and
sovereignty of the South</i>, would be postponed. If there was a
pledge here it was a pledge not to recognize Southern sovereignty
until after Adams' arrival.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"></a>[V1:pg 109]</span>
<p>But even if there was no promise of delay "there can be no
question," writes the son of Adams in a brief biography of his
father, "that the proclamation of the 13th was issued with unseemly
haste.... The purpose was manifest. It was to have the status of
the Confederacy as a belligerent an accomplished fact before the
arrival of the newly accredited minister. This precipitate action
was chiefly significant as indicating an animus; that animus being
really based on ... the belief, already matured into a conviction,
that the full recognition of the Confederacy as an independent
power was merely a question of time, and probably of a very short
time<a name="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191">[191]</a>."
The author does not, however, support the contemporary American
contention that <i>any</i> Proclamation was contrary to
international custom and that no recognition of belligerent status
was permissible to neutrals until the "insurgents" had forced the
mother country itself to recognize the division as fully
accomplished, even while war still continued. Indeed American
practice was flatly contradictory of the argument, as in the very
pertinent example of the petty Canadian rebellion of 1837, when
President Van Buren had promptly issued a proclamation of
neutrality. It is curious that in his several replies to Seward's
complaints Russell did not quote a letter from Stevenson, the
American Minister to London, addressed to Palmerston, May 22, 1838.
Stevenson was demanding disavowal and disapproval of the "Caroline"
affair, and incidentally he asserted as an incontrovertible
principle "that civil wars are not distinguished from other wars,
as to belligerent and neutral rights; that they stand upon the same
ground, and are governed by the same principles; that whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110"></a>[V1:pg 110]</span> a
portion of a State seek by force of arms to overthrow the
Government, and maintain independence, the contest becomes one
<i>de facto</i> of war<a name="FNanchor192"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_192">[192]</a>." This was as exact, and correct, a
statement of the British view as could have been desired<a name=
"FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193">[193]</a>.</p>
<p>The American Minister, whatever his official representation, did
not then hold, privately, the view of "unfriendly animus." On July
2, 1861, his secretary son wrote: "The English are really on our
side; of that I have no doubt whatever. [Later he was less sure of
this.] But they thought that as a dissolution seemed inevitable and
as we seemed to have made up our minds to it, that their
Proclamation was just the thing to keep them straight with both
sides, and when it turned out otherwise they did their best to
correct their mistake<a name="FNanchor194"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_194">[194]</a>." The modern historical judgment of the
best American writers likewise exonerates the British Government of
"unfriendly animus<a name="FNanchor195"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_195">[195]</a>," but is still apt to refer to the
"premature" issue of the Proclamation.</p>
<p>This was also John Bright's view. But can Russell and the
Government be criticized even as exercising an unwise (not
unfriendly) haste? Henry Adams wrote that the British thought the
"dissolution seemed inevitable" and "we seemed to have made up our
minds to it." Certainly this was a justifiable conclusion from the
events in America from Lincoln's election in November, 1860, to his
inauguration in March, 1861--and even to a later date, almost in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"></a>[V1:pg 111]</span>
fact to the first week in April. During this period the British
Ministry preserved a strictly "hands off" policy. Then, suddenly,
actual conflict begins and at once each side in America issues
declarations, Davis on privateering, Lincoln on blockade and
piracy, indicative that <i>maritime</i> war, the form of war at
once most dangerous to British interests and most likely to draw in
British citizens, was the method first to be tried by the
contestants. Unless these declarations were mere bluff and bluster
England could not dare wait their application. She must at once
warn her citizens and make clear her position as a neutral. The
Proclamation was no effort "to keep straight with both sides"; it
was simply the natural, direct, and prompt notification to British
subjects required in the presence of a <i>de facto</i> war.</p>
<p>Moreover, merely as a matter of historical speculation, it was
fortunate that the Proclamation antedated the arrival of Adams. The
theory of the Northern administration under which the Civil War was
begun and concluded was that a portion of the people of the United
States were striving as "insurgents" to throw off their allegiance,
and that there could be no recognition of any Southern
<i>Government</i> in the conflict. In actual practice in war, the
exchange of prisoners and like matters, this theory had soon to be
discarded. Yet it was a far-seeing and wise theory nevertheless in
looking forward to the purely domestic and constitutional problem
of the return to the Union, when conquered, of the sections in
rebellion. This, unfortunately, was not clear to foreign nations,
and it necessarily complicated relations with them. Yet under that
theory Adams had to act. Had he arrived before the Proclamation of
Neutrality it is difficult to see how he could have proceeded
otherwise than to protest, officially, against any British
declaration of neutrality, declaring that his Government did not
acknowledge a state of war as existing, and threatening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"></a>[V1:pg 112]</span> to
take his leave. It would have been his duty to <i>prevent</i>, if
possible, the issue of the Proclamation. Dallas, fortunately, had
been left uninformed and uninstructed. Adams, fortunately, arrived
too late to prevent and had, therefore, merely to complain. The
"premature" issue of the Proclamation averted an inevitable rupture
of relations on a clash between the American theory of "no state of
war" and the international fact that war existed. Had that rupture
occurred, how long would the British Government and people have
remained neutral, and what would have been the ultimate fate of the
United States<a name="FNanchor196"></a><a href=

would make upon us, there would be no end to the disregard of<br>
our neutral rights, which they would show if they once felt<br>
sure of us. If I had the least hope of their being able to<br>
reconstruct the Union, or even of their being able to reduce<br>
the South to the condition of a tolerably contented or at all<br>

lead me to desire to co-operate with them. But I conceive all<br>

offers an interesting comparison with the words of the American
President Wilson, in a parallel statement at the outbreak of the
Great War in 1914. Wilson on August 3, 1914, gave a special
audience to newspaper correspondents, begging them to maintain an
attitude of calm impartiality. On August 4 he issued the first of
several neutrality proclamations in which, following the customary
language of such documents, the people were notified that
neutrality did not restrict the "full and free expression of
sympathies in public and in private." But on August 18 in an
address to the people of the United States, this legal phraseology,
required by traditional usage was negatived by Wilson's appeal that
"we must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a
curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that
might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle
before another." And three weeks later, on September 8, came the
proclamation setting aside October 4 "as a day of prayer to
Almighty God," informing Him that war existed and asking His
intervention. Possibly Russell's more blunt and pithy expression
was better suited to the forthrightness of the British
public.</blockquote>

Lyons' precaution was that while his French colleague, Mercier, had
been instructed to support the British Proclamation, no official
French Proclamation was issued until June 10, and Lyons, while he
trusted Mercier, felt that this French delay needed some
explanation. Mercier told Seward, unofficially, of his instructions
and even left a copy of them, but at Seward's request made no
official communication. Lyons, later, followed the same procedure.
This method of dealing with Seward came to be a not unusual one,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>BRITISH SUSPICION OF SEWARD</h3>
<br>
<p>The incidents narrated in the preceding chapter have been
considered solely from the point of view of a formal American
contention as to correct international practice and the British
answer to that contention. In fact, however, there were intimately
connected wth these formal arguments and instructions of the
American Secretary of State a plan of possible militant action
against Great Britain and a suspicion, in British Governmental
circles, that this plan was being rapidly matured. American
historians have come to stigmatize this plan as "Seward's Foreign
War Panacea," and it has been examined by them in great detail, so
that there is no need here to do more than state its main features.
That which is new in the present treatment is the British
information in regard to the plan and the resultant British
suspicion of Seward's intentions.</p>
<p>The British public, as distinguished from the Government,
deriving its knowledge of Seward from newspaper reports of his
career and past utterances, might well consider him as
traditionally unfriendly to Great Britain. He had, in the 'fifties,
vigorously attacked the British interpretation of the
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and characterized Great Britain as "the most
grasping and the most rapacious Power in the world"; he had long
prophesied the ultimate annexation of Canada to the United States;
he had not disdained, in political struggles in the State of New
York, to whip up, for the sake of votes, Irish antagonism to Great
Britain; and more especially and more recently he had been reported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"></a>[V1:pg 114]</span> to
have expressed to the Duke of Newcastle a belief that civil
conflict in America could easily be avoided, or quieted, by
fomenting a quarrel with England and engaging in a war against
her<a name="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197">[197]</a>.
Earlier expressions might easily be overlooked as emanating from a
politician never over-careful about wounding the sensibilities of
foreign nations and peoples, for he had been even more outspoken
against the France of Louis Napoleon, but the Newcastle
conversation stuck in the British mind as indicative of a probable
animus when the politician had become the statesman responsible for
foreign policy. Seward might deny, as he did, that he had ever
uttered the words alleged<a name="FNanchor198"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_198">[198]</a>, and his friend Thurlow Weed might
describe the words as "badinage," in a letter to the London
<i>Times</i><a name="FNanchor199"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_199">[199]</a>, but the "Newcastle story" continued to
be matter for frequent comment both in the Press and in private
circles.</p>
<p>British Ministers, however, would have paid little attention to
Seward's speeches intended for home political consumption, or to a
careless bit of social talk, had there not been suspicion of other
and more serious evidences of unfriendliness. Lyons was an
unusually able and well-informed Minister, and from the first he
had pictured the leadership of Seward in the new administration at
Washington, and had himself been worried by his inability to
understand what policy Seward was formulating. But, in fact, he did
not see clearly what was going on in the camp of the Republican
party now dominant in the North. The essential feature of the
situation was that Seward, generally regarded as the man whose
wisdom must guide the ill-trained Lincoln, and himself thinking
this to be his destined function, early found his authority
challenged by other leaders, and his <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_115"></a>[V1:pg 115]</span> policies not certain of
acceptance by the President. It is necessary to review, briefly,
the situation at Washington.</p>

<b>WILLIAM HENRY SEWARD</b><br>
(<i>From Lord Newton's "Life of Lord Lyons," by kind
permission</i>)</p>
<br>
<p>Lincoln was inaugurated as President on March 4. He had been
elected as a Republican by a political party never before in power.
Many of the leading members of this party were drawn from the older
parties and had been in administrative positions in either State or
National Governments, but there were no party traditions, save the
lately created one of opposition to the expansion of slavery to the
Territories. All was new, then, to the men now in power in the
National Government, and a new and vital issue, that of secession
already declared by seven Southern States, had to be met by a
definite policy. The important immediate question was as to whether
Lincoln had a policy, or, if not, upon whom he would depend to
guide him.</p>
<p>In the newly-appointed Cabinet were two men who, in popular
estimate, were expected to take the lead--Chase, of Ohio, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and Seward, of New York, Secretary of
State. Both were experienced in political matters and both stood
high in the esteem of the anti-slavery element in the North, but
Seward, all things considered, was regarded as the logical leading
member of the Cabinet. He had been the favoured candidate for
Republican Presidential nomination in 1860, making way for Lincoln
only on the theory that the latter as less Radical on anti-slavery,
could be more easily elected. Also, he now held that position which
by American tradition was regarded as the highest in the
Cabinet.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone at Washington regarded it as certain that
Seward would determine the policy of the new administration.
Seward's own attitude is well summed up in a despatch to his
Government, February 18, 1861, by Rudolph Schleiden, Minister from
the Republic of Bremen. He described a conversation with Seward in
regard to his relations with Lincoln:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"></a>[V1:pg 116]</span>
<blockquote>"Seward, however, consoled himself with the clever
remark, that there is no great difference between an elected
president of the United States and an hereditary monarch. The
latter is called to the throne through the accident of birth, the
former through the chances which make his election possible. The
actual direction of public affairs belongs to the leader of the
ruling party, here as well as in any hereditary principality.<br>
<br>
"The future President is a self-made man and there is therefore as
little doubt of his energy as of his proverbial honesty ('honest
old Abe'). It is also acknowledged that he does not lack common
sense. But his other qualities for the highest office are
practically unknown. His election may therefore be readily compared
with a lottery. It is possible that the United States has drawn the
first prize, on the other hand the gain may only have been a small
one. But unfortunately the possibility is not excluded that it may
have been merely a blank."</blockquote>
<p>The first paragraph of this quotation reports Seward's opinion;
the second is apparently Schleiden's own estimate. Two weeks later
Schleiden sent home a further analysis of Lincoln:</p>
<blockquote>"He makes the impression of a natural man of clear and
healthy mind, great good-naturedness and best intentions. He seems
to be fully conscious of the great responsibility which rests upon
him. But at the same time it appears as if he had lost some of his
famous firmness and resoluteness through the novelty of the
conditions which surround him and the hourly renewed attempts from
various sides to gain influence over him. He is therefore at
present inclined to concede double weight to the superior political
experience of his Secretary of State<a name=
"FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200">[200]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"></a>[V1:pg 117]</span>
<p>This was written on March 4, and the situation was correctly
described. Seward led for the moment, but his supremacy was not
unchallenged and soon a decision was called for that in its final
solution was to completely overthrow his already matured policy
towards the seceding States. Buchanan had been pressed by South
Carolina to yield possession of federal property in that State and
especially to withdraw Federal troops from Fort Sumter in
Charleston Harbour. After some vacillation he had refused to do
this, but had taken no steps to reinforce and re-supply the weak
garrison under the command of Major Anderson. On March 5, Lincoln
learned that Sumter would soon have to be yielded unless
reinforcements were sent. There followed ten days of delay and
indecision; then on March 15 Lincoln requested from each member of
his Cabinet an opinion on what should be done. This brought to an
issue the whole question of Seward's policy and leadership.</p>
<p>For Seward's policy, like that of Buchanan, was one of
conciliatory delay, taking no steps to bring matters to an issue,
and trusting to time and a sobering second thought to bring
Southern leaders and people to a less violent attitude. He
sincerely believed in the existence of an as yet unvoiced strong
Union sentiment in the South, especially in those States which were
wavering on secession. He was holding communications, through
intermediaries, with certain Confederate "Commissioners" in
Washington, and he had agents in Virginia attempting to influence
that State against secession. To all these Southern representatives
he now conveyed assurances quite without warrant from Lincoln, that
Sumter would be evacuated, acting solely in the belief that his own
"policy" would be approved by the President. His argument in reply
to Lincoln's call for an opinion was positive against reinforcing
Fort Sumter, and it seemed to meet, for the moment, with the
approval of the majority of his Cabinet colleagues. Lincoln himself
made no pertinent comment, yet did not commit himself. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_118"></a>[V1:pg 118]</span> There the
matter rested for a time, for the Confederate Commissioners,
regarding Seward's policy of delay as wholly beneficial to the
maturing of Southern plans, and Seward "as their cat's-paw<a name=
"FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201">[201]</a>," did not care
to press for a decision. Moreover, Seward had given a personal
pledge that in case it were, after all, determined to reinforce
Sumter, notification of that determination would at once be given
to South Carolina. The days went by, and it was not until the last
week of March that Lincoln, disillusioned as to the feasibility of
Seward's policy of conciliation, reached the conclusion that in his
conception of his duty as President of the United States he must
defend and retain Federal forts, or attempt to retain them, for the
preservation of the Union, and decided to reinforce Fort Sumter. On
March 29, the Cabinet assembled at noon and learned Lincoln's
determination.</p>
<p>This was a sharp blow to Seward's prestige in the Cabinet; it
also threatened his "peaceful" policy. Yet he did not as yet
understand fully that either supreme leadership, or control of
policy, had been assumed by Lincoln. On April 1 he drafted that
astonishing document entitled, "Some Thoughts for the President's
Consideration," which at once reveals his alarm and his supreme
personal self-confidence. This document begins, "We are at the end
of a month's administration, and yet without a policy <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_119"></a>[V1:pg 119]</span> either domestic
or foreign." It then advocates as a domestic policy, "<i>Change The
Question Before The Public From One Upon Slavery, Or About
Slavery</i>, for a question upon <i>Union or Disunion</i>." Then in
a second section, headed "For Foreign Nations," there followed:</p>
<blockquote>"I would demand explanations from Spain and France,
categorically, at once.<br>
<br>
"I would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia, and send
agents into Canada, Mexico and Central America to rouse a vigorous
continental spirit of independence on this continent against
European intervention.<br>
<br>
"And, if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and
France.<br>
<br>
"Would convene Congress and declare war against them.<br>
<br>
"But whatever policy we adopt, there must be energetic prosecution
of it.<br>
<br>
"For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and
direct it incessantly.<br>
<br>
"Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while
active in it, or<br>
<br>
"Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on
it must end, and all agree and abide.<br>
<br>
"It is not in my especial province;<br>
<br>
"But I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility<a name=
"FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202">[202]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lincoln's reply of the same day, April 1, was characteristically
gentle, yet no less positive and definite to any save one obsessed
with his own superior wisdom. Lincoln merely noted that Seward's
"domestic policy" was exactly his own, except that he did not
intend to abandon Fort Sumter. As to the warlike foreign policy
Lincoln pointed out that this would be a sharp reversal of that
already being prepared in circulars and instructions to Ministers
abroad. This was, indeed, the case, for the first instructions,
soon despatched, were drawn on lines of recalling to foreign powers
their established and long-continued friendly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_120"></a>[V1:pg 120]</span> relations with
the United States. Finally, Lincoln stated as to the required
"guiding hand," "I remark that if this must be done, I must do
it.... I wish, and suppose I am entitled to have, the advice of all
the Cabinet<a name="FNanchor203"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_203">[203]</a>."</p>
<p>This should have been clear indication of Lincoln's will to
direct affairs, and even to Seward would have been sufficient had
he not, momentarily, been so disturbed by the wreck of his pacific
policy toward the South, and as yet so ignorant of the strength of
Lincoln's quiet persistence. As it was, he yielded on the immediate
issue, the relief of Sumter (though attempting to divert
reinforcements to another quarter) but did not as yet wholly yield
either his policy of conciliation and delay, nor give up
immediately his insane scheme of saving the Union by plunging it
into a foreign war. He was, in fact, still giving assurances to the
Confederate commissioners, through indirect channels, that he could
and would prevent the outbreak of civil war, and in this confidence
that his ideas would finally control Lincoln he remained up to the
second week in April. But on April 8 the first of the ships
despatched to the aid of Sumter left New York, and on that day
Governor Pickens of South Carolina was officially notified of the
Northern purpose. This threw the burden of striking the first blow
upon the South; if Southern threats were now made good, civil war
seemed inevitable, and there could be no peaceful decision of the
quarrel.</p>
<p>The reinforcements did not arrive in time. Fort Sumter, after a
day and a half of dogged fighting, was surrendered to the enemy on
April 13--for as an enemy in arms the South now stood. The fall of
Sumter changed, as in a moment, the whole attitude of the Northern
people. There was now a nearly unanimous cry for the preservation
of the Union <i>by force</i>. Yet Seward still clung, privately, to
his belief that even now the "sober second thought" of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"></a>[V1:pg 121]</span>
South would offer a way out toward reunion without war. In official
utterances and acts he was apparently in complete harmony with the
popular will to reconquer the South. Davis' proclamation on marque
and privateering, of April 17, was answered by the Lincoln blockade
proclamation of April 19. But Virginia had not yet officially
seceded, and until this occurred there seemed to Seward at least
one last straw of conciliation available. In this situation
Schleiden, Minister for Bremen, came to Seward on the morning of
April 24 and offered his services as a mediator<a name=
"FNanchor204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204">[204]</a>.</p>
<p>Schleiden's idea was that an armistice be agreed upon with the
South until the Northern Congress should meet in July, thus giving
a breathing spell and permitting saner second judgment to both
sides. He had consulted with his Prussian colleague, who approved,
and he found Seward favourable to the plan. Alexander H. Stephens,
Vice-President of the Confederacy, was then at Richmond, and to
him, as an old friend, Schleiden proposed to go and make the same
appeal. Seward at once took Schleiden to see Lincoln. The three
men, with Chase (and the Prussian Minister) were the only ones in
the secret. Lincoln's first comment was that he was "willing to
make an attempt of contributing to the prevention of bloodshed and
regretted that Schleiden had not gone to Richmond without
consulting him or Seward." Lincoln further stated that "he did not
have in mind any aggression against the Southern States, but merely
the safety of the Government in the Capitol and the possibility to
govern everywhere," a concluding phrase that should have
enlightened Schleiden as to Lincoln's determination to preserve the
Union. Lincoln said he could neither authorize negotiations nor
invite proposals, but that he would gladly consider any such
proposals voluntarily made. Schleiden asked for a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"></a>[V1:pg 122]</span>
statement as to whether Lincoln would recall the blockade
proclamation and sign an armistice if Davis would recall the
letters of marque proclamation, but Lincoln refused to commit
himself.</p>
<p>This was scant encouragement from the President, but Seward
still thought something might result from the venture, and on that
evening, April 24, Schleiden started for Richmond, being provided
by Seward with a pass through the Union lines. He arrived on the
afternoon of the twenty-fifth, but even before reaching the city
was convinced that his mission would be a failure. All along his
journey, at each little station, he saw excited crowds assembled
enthusiastic for secession, bands of militia training, and every
indication of preparation for war. Already, on that same day, the
Virginia secession ordinance had been published, and the State
convention had ratified the provisional constitution of the
Southern Confederacy. Schleiden immediately notified Stephens of
his presence in Richmond and desire for an interview, and was at
once received. The talk lasted three hours. Stephens was frank and
positive in asserting the belief that "all attempts to settle
peacefully the differences between the two sections were futile."
Formal letters were exchanged after this conference, but in these
the extent to which Stephens would go was to promise to use his
influence in favour of giving consideration to any indication made
by the North of a desire "for an amicable adjustment of the
questions at issue," and he was positive that there could be no
return of the South to the Union.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 27 Schleiden was back in Washington.
He found that three days had made a great change in the sentiment
of the Capitol. "During my short absence," he wrote, "many
thousands of volunteers had arrived from the North. There was not
only a feeling of security noticeable, but even of combativeness."
He found <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123"></a>[V1:pg
123]</span> Seward not at all disposed to pursue the matter, and
was not given an opportunity to talk to Lincoln; therefore, he
merely submitted copies of the letters that had passed between him
and Stephens, adding for himself that the South was arming
<i>because</i> of Lincoln's proclamation calling for volunteers.
Seward replied on April 29, stating his personal regards and that
he had no fault to find with Schleiden's efforts, but concluding
that Stephens' letters gave no ground for action since the "Union
of these States is the supreme as it is the organic law of this
country," and must be maintained.</p>
<p>This adventure to Richmond by the Minister of Bremen may be
regarded as Seward's last struggle to carry out his long-pursued
policy of conciliatory delay. He had not officially sent Schleiden
to Richmond, but he had grasped eagerly at the opening and had
encouraged and aided Schleiden in his journey. Now, by April 27,
hope had vanished, and Seward's "domestic policy," as set forth in
his "Thoughts for the President's Consideration" on April 1, was
discredited, and inevitably, in some measure, their author also.
The dates are important in appreciating Seward's purposes. On April
27, the day of Schleiden's return to Washington, there was sent to
Adams that "sharp" despatch, taking issue with British action as
foreshadowed by Dallas on April 9, and concluding by instructing
Adams to lose no time in warning Russell that such action would be
regarded by the United States as "injurious to its rights and
derogating from its dignity<a name="FNanchor205"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_205">[205]</a>." It appears, therefore, that Seward,
defeated on one line of "policy," eager to regain prestige, and
still obsessed with the idea that some means could yet be found to
avert <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"></a>[V1:pg
124]</span> domestic conflict, was, on April 27, beginning to pick
at those threads which, to his excited thought, might yet save the
Union through a foreign war. He was now seeking to force the
acceptance of the second, and alternative, portion of his "Thoughts
for the President."</p>
<p>Seward's theory of the cementing effect of a foreign war was no
secret at Washington. As early as January 26 he had unfolded to
Schleiden this fantastic plan. "If the Lord would only give the
United States an excuse for a war with England, France, or Spain,"
he said "that would be the best means of re-establishing internal
peace<a name="FNanchor206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206">[206]</a>."
Again, on February 10, he conversed with Schleiden on the same
topic, and complained that there was no foreign complication
offering an excuse for a break. Lyons knew of this attitude, and by
February 4 had sent Russell a warning, to which the latter had
replied on February 20 that England could afford to be patient for
a time but that too much "blustering demonstration" must not be
indulged in. But the new administration, as Lincoln had remarked in
his reply to Seward on April 1, had taken quite another line,
addressing foreign powers in terms of high regard for established
friendly relations. This was the tone of Seward's first instruction
to Adams, April 10<a name="FNanchor207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_207">[207]</a>, in the concluding paragraph of which
Seward wrote, "The United States are not indifferent to the
circumstances of common descent, language, customs, sentiments, and
religion, which recommend a closer sympathy between themselves and
Great Britain than either might expect in its intercourse with any
other nation." True, on this basis, Seward claimed a special
sympathy from Great Britain for the United States, that is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"></a>[V1:pg 125]</span>
say, the North, but most certainly the tone of this first
instruction was one of established friendship.</p>
<p>Yet now, April 27, merely on learning from Dallas that Russell
"refuses to pledge himself" on British policy, Seward resorts to
threats. What other explanation is possible except that, seeking to
save his domestic policy of conciliation and to regain his
leadership, he now was adventuring toward the application of his
"foreign war panacea" idea. Lyons quickly learned of the changed
tone, and that England, especially, was to hear American complaint.
On May 2 Lyons wrote to Russell in cypher characterizing Seward as
"arrogant and reckless toward Foreign Powers<a name=
"FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208">[208]</a>." Evidently
Seward was making little concealment of his belligerent attitude,
and when the news was received of the speeches in Parliament of the
first week in May by which it became clear that Great Britain would
declare neutrality and was planning joint action with France, he
became much excited. On May 17 he wrote a letter home exhibiting,
still, an extraordinary faith in his own wisdom and his own foreign
policy.</p>
<blockquote>"A country so largely relying on my poor efforts to
save it had [has] refused me the full measure of its confidence,
needful to that end. I am a chief reduced to a subordinate
position, and surrounded by a guard, to see that I do not do too
much for my country, lest some advantage may revert indirectly to
my own fame.<br>
<br>
"... They have misunderstood things fearfully, in Europe, Great
Britain is in danger of sympathizing so much with the South, for
the sake of peace and cotton, as to drive us to make war against
her, as the ally of the traitors.... I am trying to get a bold
remonstrance through the Cabinet before it is too late<a name=
"FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209">[209]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The "bold remonstrance" was the famous "Despatch No. 10," of May
21, already commented upon in the preceding <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_126"></a>[V1:pg 126]</span> chapter. But as
sent to Adams it varied in very important details from the draft
submitted by Seward to Lincoln<a name="FNanchor210"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_210">[210]</a>.</p>
<p>Seward's draft was not merely a "remonstrance"; it was a
challenge. Its language implied that the United States desired war,
and Seward's plan was to have Adams read the despatch to Russell,
give him a copy of it, and then discontinue diplomatic relations so
long as Russell held either official or unofficial intercourse with
the Southern Commissioners. This last instruction was, indeed,
retained in the final form of the despatch, but here, as elsewhere,
Lincoln modified the stiff expressions of the original. Most
important of all, he directed Adams to consider the whole despatch
as for his own guidance, relying on his discretion. The despatch,
as amended, began with the statement that the United States
"neither means to menace Great Britain nor to wound the
sensibilities of that or any other European nation.... The paper
itself is not to be read or shown to the British Secretary of
State, nor any of its positions to be prematurely, unnecessarily,
or indiscreetly made known. But its spirit will be your
guide<a name="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211">[211]</a>."
Thus were the teeth <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_127"></a>[V1:pg 127]</span> skilfully drawn from the threat
of war. Even the positive instructions, later in the despatch, as
to the Southern Commissioners, need not have been acted upon by
Adams had he not thought it wise to do so. But even with
alterations, the American remonstrance was so bold as to alarm
Adams. On first perusual he wrote in his diary, June 10, "The
Government seems almost ready to declare war with all the powers of
Europe, and almost instructs me to withdraw from communication with
the Ministers here in a certain contingency.... I scarcely know how
to understand Mr. Seward. The rest of the Government may be
demented for all I know; but he surely is calm and wise. My duty
here is in so far as I can do it honestly to prevent the irritation
from coming to a downright quarrel. It seems to me like throwing
the game into the hands of the enemy<a name=
"FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212">[212]</a>."</p>
<p>Adams, a sincere admirer of Seward, was in error as to the
source of American belligerent attitude. Fortunately, his judgment
of what was wise at the moment coincided with that of
Lincoln's--though of this he had no knowledge. In the event Adams'
skilful handling of the situation resulted favourably--even to the
cessation of intercourse between Russell and the Southern
Commissioners. For his part, Lincoln, no more than earlier, was to
be hurried into foreign complications, and Seward's "foreign war
panacea" was stillborn.</p>
<p>The incident was a vital one in the Northern administration, for
Seward at last realized that the President intended to control
policy, and though it was yet long before he came to appreciate
fully Lincoln's customary calm judgment, he did understand the
relation now established between <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_128"></a>[V1:pg 128]</span> himself and his chief.
Henceforth, he obeyed orders, though free in suggestion and
criticism, always welcome to Lincoln. The latter, avowedly ignorant
of diplomacy, gladly left details to Seward, and the altered
despatch, far from making relations difficult, rendered them simple
and easy, by clearing the atmosphere. But it was otherwise with
Foreign Ministers at Washington, for even though there was soon a
"leak" of gossip informing them of what had taken place in regard
to Despatch No. 10, they one and all were fearful of a recovery of
influence by Seward and of a resumption of belligerent policy. This
was particularly true of Lord Lyons, for rumour had it that it was
against England that Seward most directed his enmity. There
resulted for British diplomats both at Washington and in London a
deep-seated suspicion of Seward, long after he had made a complete
face-about in policy. This suspicion influenced relations greatly
in the earlier years of the Civil War.</p>
<p>On May 20, the day before Seward's No. 10 was dated, Lyons wrote
a long twelve-page despatch to Russell, anxious, and very full of
Seward's warlike projects. "The President is, of course, wholly
ignorant of foreign countries, and of foreign affairs." "Seward,
having lost strength by the failure of his peace policy, is seeking
to recover influence by leading a foreign war party; no one in the
Cabinet is strong enough to combat him." Britain, Lyons thought,
should maintain a stiff attitude, prepare to defend Canada, and
make close contacts with France. He was evidently anxious to
impress upon Russell that Seward really might mean war, but he
declared the chief danger to lie in the fact of American belief
that England and France could not be driven into war with the
United States, and that they would submit to any insult. Lyons
urged some action, or declaration (he did not know what), to
correct this false impression<a name="FNanchor213"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_213">[213]</a>. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_129"></a>[V1:pg 129]</span> Again, on the next day, May 21,
the information in his official despatch was repeated in a private
letter to Russell, but Lyons here interprets Seward's threats as
mere bluster. Yet he is not absolutely sure of this, and in any
case insists that the best preventative of war with the United
States is to show that England is ready for it<a name=
"FNanchor214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214">[214]</a>.</p>
<p>It was an anxious time for the British Minister in Washington.
May 22, he warned Sir Edmund Head, Governor of Canada, urging him
to make defensive preparation<a name="FNanchor215"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_215">[215]</a>. The following day he dilated to Russell,
privately, on "the difficulty of keeping Mr. Seward within the
bounds of decency even in ordinary social intercourse<a name=
"FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216">[216]</a> ..." and in an
official communication of this same day he records Washington
rumours of a belligerent despatch read by Seward before the
Cabinet, of objections by other members, and that Seward's
insistence has carried the day<a name="FNanchor217"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_217">[217]</a>. That Seward was, in fact, still smarting
over his reverse is shown by a letter, written on this same May 23,
to his intimate friend and political adviser, Thurlow Weed, who had
evidently cautioned him against precipitate action. Seward wrote,
"The European phase is bad. But your apprehension that I may be too
decisive alarms me more. Will you consent, or advise us to consent,
that Adams and Dayton have audiences and compliments in the
Ministers' Audience Chamber, and Toombs' [Confederate Secretary of
State] emissaries have access to his bedroom<a name=
"FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218">[218]</a>?"</p>
<p>Two interpretations are possible from this: either <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_130"></a>[V1:pg 130]</span> that Seward
knowing himself defeated was bitter in retrospect, or that he had
not yet yielded his will to that of Lincoln, in spite of the
changes made in his Despatch No. 10. The former interpretation
seems the more likely, for though Seward continued to write for a
time "vigorous" despatches to Adams, they none of them approached
the vigour of even the amended despatch. Moreover, the exact facts
of the Cabinet of May 21, and the complete reversal of Seward's
policy were sufficiently known by May 24 to have reached the ears
of Schleiden, who reported them in a letter to Bremen of that
date<a name="FNanchor219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219">[219]</a>.
And on the same day Seward himself told Schleiden that he did "not
fear any longer that it would come to a break with England<a name=
"FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220">[220]</a>." On May 27
Lyons himself, though still suspicious that an attempt was being
made to separate France and England, was able to report a better
tone from Seward<a name="FNanchor221"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_221">[221]</a>.</p>
<p>British Ministers in London were not so alarmed as was Lyons,
but they were disturbed, nevertheless, and long preserved a
suspicion of the American Secretary of State. May 23, Palmerston
wrote to Russell in comment on Lyons' despatch of May 2: "These
communications are very unpleasant. It is not at all unlikely that
either from foolish and uncalculating arrogance and
self-sufficiency or from political calculation Mr. Seward may bring
on a quarrel with us<a name="FNanchor222"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_222">[222]</a>." He believed that more troops ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131"></a>[V1:pg 131]</span> to
be sent to Canada, as a precautionary measure, but, he added, "the
main Force for Defence must, of course, be local"--a situation
necessarily a cause for anxiety by British Ministers. Russell was
less perturbed. He had previously expressed appreciation of Adams'
conduct, writing to Lyons: "Mr. Adams has made a very favourable
impression on my mind as a calm and judicious man<a name=
"FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223">[223]</a>," and he now
wrote: "I do not think Mr. Seward's colleagues will encourage him
in a game of brag with England.... I am sorry Seward turns out so
reckless and ruthless. Adams seems a sensible man<a name=
"FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224">[224]</a>." But at
Washington Lyons was again hot on the trail of warlike rumours. As
a result of a series of conversations with Northern politicians,
not Cabinet members, he sent a cipher telegram to Russell on June
6, stating: "No new event has occurred but sudden declaration of
war by the United States against Great Britain appears to me by no
means impossible, especially so long as Canada seems open to
invasion<a name="FNanchor225"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_225">[225]</a>." This was followed two days later by a
despatch dilating upon the probability of war, and ending with
Lyons' opinion of how it should be conducted. England should strike
at once with the largest possible naval force and bring the war to
an end before the United States could prepare. Otherwise, "the
spirit, the energy, and the resources of this people" would make
them difficult to overcome. England, on her part, must be prepared
to suffer severely from American privateers, and she would be
forced to help the South, at least to the extent of keeping
Southern ports open. Finally, Lyons concluded, all of this letter
and advice were extremely distasteful to him, yet he felt compelled
to write it by the seriousness of the situation. Nevertheless, he
would exert every effort and use every method to conciliate
America<a name="FNanchor226"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_226">[226]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"></a>[V1:pg 132]</span>
<p>In truth, it was not any further belligerent talk by Seward that
had so renewed Lyons' anxiety. Rather it was the public and Press
reception of the news of the Queen's Proclamation of Neutrality.
The Northern people, counting beyond all reasonable expectation
upon British sympathy on anti-slavery grounds, had been angrily
disappointed, and were at the moment loudly voicing their vexation.
Had Seward not already been turned from his foreign war policy he
now would have received strong public support in it. But he made no
effort to utilize public excitement to his own advantage in the
Cabinet. In England, Adams was able to report on June 14 that
Russell had no intention of holding further interviews with the
Southern Commissioners<a name="FNanchor227"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_227">[227]</a>, but before anyone in Washington could
learn of this there was general knowledge of a changed tone from
the Secretary of State, and Lyons' fears were considerably allayed.
On June 15, occurred that interview between Seward, Lyons, and
Mercier, in which Seward had positively refused to receive the
Queen's Proclamation, but had throughout evinced the greatest
courtesy and goodwill. Lyons so reported the conversation<a name=
"FNanchor228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228">[228]</a>. June 15 may,
in fact, be taken as the date when Lyons ceased to be alarmed over
an immediate war. Possibly he found it a little difficult to report
so sudden a shift from stormy to fair weather. June 21, he wrote
that the "lull" was still continuing<a name=
"FNanchor229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229">[229]</a>. June 24, he at
last learned and described at length the details of Lincoln's
alteration of Despatch No. 10<a name="FNanchor230"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_230">[230]</a>. He <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_133"></a>[V1:pg 133]</span> did not know the exact date but
he expressed the opinion that "a month or three weeks ago" war was
very near--a misjudgment, since it should be remembered that war
seemed advisable to one man only--Seward; and that on this issue he
had been definitely cast down from his self-assumed leadership into
the ranks of Lincoln's lieutenants.</p>
<p>Lyons was, then, nearly a month behindhand in exact knowledge of
American foreign policy toward England, and he was in error in
thinking that an American attack on England was either imminent or
intended. Nevertheless, he surely was excusable, considering
Seward's prestige and Lincoln's lack of it, in reporting as he did.
It was long, indeed, before he could escape from suspicion of
Seward's purposes, though dropping, abruptly, further comment on
the chances of war. A month later, on July 20, he wrote that Seward
had himself asked for a confidential and unofficial interview, in
order to make clear that there never had been any intention of
stirring agitation against England. Personally, Seward took credit
for avoiding trouble "by refusing to take official cognizance of
the recognition [by England] of the belligerent rights of the
South," and he asked Lyons to explain to Russell that previous
strong language was intended merely to make foreign Powers
understand the intensity of Northern feeling<a name=
"FNanchor231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231">[231]</a>.</p>
<p>Lyons put no faith in all this but was happy to note the change,
mistakenly attributing it to England's "stiff tone," and not at all
to the veto of the President. Since Lyons himself had gone to the
utmost bounds in seeking conciliation (so he had reported), and, in
London, Russell also had taken no forward step since the issue of
the Queen's Proclamation--indeed, had rather yielded somewhat to
Adams' representations--it is not clear in what the "stiff tone"
consisted.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cause of Seward's explanation to Lyons <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_134"></a>[V1:pg 134]</span> was the receipt
of a despatch from Adams, dated June 28, in which the latter had
reported that all was now smooth sailing. He had told Russell that
the knowledge in Washington of the result of their previous
interviews had brought satisfaction, and Russell, for his part,
said that Lyons had "learned, through another member of the
diplomatic corps, that no further expression of opinion on the
subject in question would be necessary<a name=
"FNanchor232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232">[232]</a>." This
referred, presumably, to the question of British intention, for the
future, in relation to the Proclamation of Neutrality. Adams wrote:
"This led to the most frank and pleasant conversation which I have
yet had with his lordship.... I added that I believed the popular
feeling in the United States would subside the moment that all the
later action on this side was known.... My own reception has been
all that I could desire. I attach value to this, however, only as
it indicates the establishment of a policy that will keep us at
peace during the continuance of the present convulsion." In reply
to Adams' despatch, Seward wrote on July 21, the day after his
interview with Lyons, arguing at great length the American view
that the British Proclamation of Neutrality in a domestic quarrel
was not defensible in international law. There was not now, nor
later, any yielding on this point. But, for the present, this was
intended for Adams' eye alone, and Seward prefaced his argument by
a disclaimer, much as stated to Lyons, of any ill-will to Great
Britain:</p>
<blockquote>"I may add, also, for myself, that however otherwise I
may at any time have been understood, it has been an earnest and
profound solicitude to avert from foreign war; that alone has
prompted the emphatic and sometimes, perhaps, impassioned
remonstrances I have hitherto made against any form or measure of
recognition of the insurgents by the government of Great Britain. I
write in the same spirit now; and I invoke on the part of the
British government, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_135"></a>[V1:pg 135]</span> as I propose to exercise on my
own, the calmness which all counsellors ought to practise in
debates which involve the peace and happiness of mankind<a name=
"FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233">[233]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Diplomatic correspondence couched in the form of platform
oratory leads to the suspicion that the writer is thinking,
primarily, of the ultimate publication of his despatches. Thus
Seward seems to have been laying the ground for a denial that he
had ever developed a foolish foreign war policy. History pins him
to that folly. But in another respect the interview with Lyons on
July 20 and the letter to Adams of the day following overthrow for
both Seward and for the United States the accusations sometimes
made that it was the Northern disaster at Bull Run, July 21, in the
first pitched battle with the South, which made more temperate the
Northern tone toward foreign powers<a name=
"FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234">[234]</a>. It is true
that the despatch to Adams was not actually sent until July 26, but
internal evidence shows it to have been written on the 21st before
there was any news from the battle-field, and the interview with
Lyons on the 20th proves that the military set-back had no
influence on Seward's friendly expressions. Moreover, these
expressions officially made were but a delayed voicing of a
determination of policy arrived at many weeks earlier. The
chronology of events and despatches cited in this chapter will have
shown that the refusal of Lincoln to follow Seward's leadership,
and the consequent lessening of the latter's "high tone," preceded
any news whatever from England, lightening the first impressions.
The Administration at Washington did not on May 21, even know that
England had issued a Proclamation of Neutrality; it knew merely of
Russell's statement that one would have to be issued; and the
friendly explanations of Russell to Adams were not received in
Washington until the month following.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"></a>[V1:pg 136]</span>
<p>In itself, Seward's "foreign war panacea" policy does not
deserve the place in history usually accorded it as a moment of
extreme crisis in British-American relations. There was never any
danger of war from it, for Lincoln nipped the policy in the bud.
The public excitement in America over the Queen's Proclamation was,
indeed, intense; but this did not alter the Governmental attitude.
In England all that the public knew was this American irritation
and clamour. The London press expressed itself a bit more
cautiously, for the moment, merely defending the necessity of
British neutrality<a name="FNanchor235"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_235">[235]</a>. But if regarded from the effect upon
British Ministers the incident was one of great, possibly even
vital, importance in the relations of the two countries. Lyons had
been gravely anxious to the point of alarm. Russell, less acutely
alarmed, was yet seriously disturbed. Both at Washington and in
London the suspicion of Seward lasted throughout the earlier years
of the war, and to British Ministers it seemed that at any moment
he might recover leadership and revert to a dangerous mood. British
attitude toward America was affected in two opposite ways; Britain
was determined not to be bullied, and Russell himself sometimes
went to the point of arrogance in answer to American complaints;
this was an unfortunate result. But more fortunate, and <i>also a
result</i>, was the British Government's determination to step
warily in the American conflict and to give no just cause, unless
on due consideration of policy, for a rupture of relations with the
United States. Seward's folly in May of 1861, from every angle but
a short-lived "brain-storm," served America well in the first years
of her great crisis.</p>

had become one of the best known and socially popular of the
Washington diplomatic corps, holding intimate relations with
leading Americans both North and South. His reports on events

me to have been an erratic feeling-out of international attitude

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE DECLARATION OF PARIS NEGOTIATION</h3>
<br>
<p>If regarded merely from the view-point of strict chronology
there accompanied Seward's "foreign war" policy a negotiation with
Great Britain which was of importance as the first effort of the
American Secretary of State to bring European nations to a definite
support of the Northern cause. It was also the first negotiation
undertaken by Adams in London, and as a man new to the diplomatic
service he attached to it an unusual importance, even, seemingly,
to the extent of permitting personal chagrin at the ultimate
failure of the negotiation to distort his usually cool and fair
judgment. The matter in question was the offer of the United States
to accede by a convention to the Declaration of Paris of 1856,
establishing certain international rules for the conduct of
maritime warfare.</p>
<p>This negotiation has received scant attention in history. It
failed to result in a treaty, therefore it has appeared to be
negligible. Yet it was at the time of very great importance in
affecting the attitude toward each other of Great Britain and the
United States, and of the men who spoke for their respective
countries. The bald facts of the negotiation appear with exactness
in Moore's <i>Digest of International Law</i><a name=
"FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236">[236]</a>, but without
comment as to motives, and, more briefly, in Bernard's
<i>Neutrality of Great Britain during the American Civil
War</i><a name="FNanchor237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237">[237]</a>,
at the conclusion of which the author <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_138"></a>[V1:pg 138]</span> writes, with
sarcasm, "I refrain from any comment on this negotiation<a name=
"FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238">[238]</a>." Nicolay and
Hay's <i>Lincoln</i>, and Rhodes' <i>United States</i>, give the
matter but passing and inadequate treatment. It was reviewed in
some detail in the American argument before the Geneva court of
arbitration in the case of the <i>Alabama</i>, but was there
presented merely as a part of the general American complaint of
British neutrality. In fact, but three historical students, so far
as the present writer has been able to discover, have examined this
negotiation in detail and presented their conclusions as to
purposes and motives--so important to an understanding of British
intentions at the moment when the flames of civil war were rapidly
spreading in America.</p>
<p>These three, each with an established historical reputation,
exhibit decided differences in interpretation of diplomatic
incidents and documents. The first careful analysis was presented
by Henry Adams, son of the American Minister in London during the
Civil War, and then acting as his private secretary, in his
<i>Historical Essays</i>, published in 1891; the second study is by
Bancroft, in his <i>Life of Seward</i>, 1900; while the third is by
Charles Francis Adams (also son of the American Minister), who, in
his <i>Life</i> of his father, published 1900, gave a chapter to
the subject and treated it on lines similar to those laid down by
his brother Henry, but who, in 1912, came to the conclusion,
through further study, that he had earlier been in error and
developed a very different view in a monograph entitled, "Seward
and the Declaration of Paris."</p>

<br>
<p>If these historiographic details seem unduly minute, partaking
as they do of the nature of a foot-note, in a work otherwise
general in treatment, the author's answer is that the personality
of two of the writers mentioned and their intimate knowledge of the
effect of the negotiation upon the mind of the American Minister in
London are themselves <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_139"></a>[V1:pg 139]</span> important historical data; a
further answer is the fact that the materials now available from
the British Foreign Office archives throw much new light both on
the course of the negotiation and on British purposes. It is here
planned, therefore, first to review the main facts as previously
known; second, to summarize the arguments and conclusions of the
three historians; third, to re-examine the negotiation in the light
of the new material; and, finally, to express an opinion on its
conduct and conclusions as an evidence of British policy.</p>
<p>In 1854, during the Crimean War, Great Britain and France, the
chief maritime belligerents engaged against Russia, voluntarily
agreed to respect neutral commerce under either the neutral's or
the enemy's flag. This was a distinct step forward in the practice
of maritime warfare, the accepted international rules of which had
not been formally altered since the Napoleonic period. The action
of Great Britain was due in part, according to a later statement in
Parliament by Palmerston, March 18, 1862, to a fear that unless a
greater respect were paid than formerly to neutral rights, the
Allies would quickly win the ill-will of the United States, then
the most powerful maritime neutral, and would run the danger of
forcing that country into belligerent alliance with Russia<a name=
"FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239">[239]</a>. No doubt there
were other reasons, also, for the barbarous rules and practices of
maritime warfare in earlier times were by now regarded as
semi-civilized by the writers of all nations. Certainly the action
of the belligerents in 1854 met with general approval and in the
result was written into international law at the Congress of Paris
in 1856, where, at the conclusion of the war, the belligerents and
some leading neutrals were gathered.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Paris on maritime warfare covered four
points:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"></a>[V1:pg 140]</span>
<blockquote>"1. Privateering is, and remains, abolished.<br>
<br>
"2. The neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of
contraband of war.<br>
<br>
"3. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not
liable to capture under enemy's flag.<br>
<br>
"4. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective; that is
to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access
to the coast of the enemy<a name="FNanchor240"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_240">[240]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This agreement was adopted by Austria, France, Great Britain,
Prussia, Russia, Sardinia and Turkey, and it was further agreed
that a general invitation to accede should be extended to all
nations, but with the proviso "that the powers which shall have
signed it, or which shall accede thereto, shall not in future enter
into any arrangement, concerning the application of the law of
neutrals in time of war, which does not rest altogether upon the
four principles embodied in the said declaration<a name=
"FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241">[241]</a>." In other
words it must be accepted in whole, and not in part, and the powers
acceding pledging themselves not to enter into any subsequent
treaties or engagements on maritime law which did not stipulate
observance of all four points. Within a short time nearly all the
maritime nations of the world had given official adherence to the
Declaration of Paris.</p>
<p>But the United States refused to do so. She had long stood in
the advance guard of nations demanding respect for neutral rights.
Little by little her avowed principles of international law as
regards neutrals, first scoffed at, had crept into acceptance in
treaty stipulations. Secretary of State Marcy now declared, in
July, 1856, that the United <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_141"></a>[V1:pg 141]</span> States would accede to the
Declaration if a fifth article were added to it protecting all
private property at sea, when not contraband. This covered not only
cargo, but the vessel as well, and its effect would have been to
exclude from belligerent operations non-contraband enemy's goods
under the enemy's flag, if goods and ship were privately owned.
Maritime warfare on the high seas would have been limited to
battles between governmentally operated war-ships. Unless this rule
were adopted also, Secretary Marcy declared that "the United States
could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past
had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and
which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting
power."</p>
<p>"War on private property," said the Americans, "had been
abolished on land; why should it not be abolished also on the sea?"
The American proposal met with general support among the smaller
maritime nations. It was believed that the one great obstacle to
the adoption of Marcy's amendment lay in the naval supremacy of
Great Britain, and that obstacle proved insurmountable. Thus the
United States refused to accede to the Declaration, and there the
matter rested until 1861. But on April 17 Jefferson Davis
proclaimed for the Southern Confederacy the issue of privateers
against Northern commerce. On April 24 Seward instructed
representatives abroad, recounting the Marcy proposal and
expressing the hope that it still might meet with a favourable
reception, but authorizing them to enter into conventions for
American adherence to the Declaration of 1856 on the four points
alone. This instruction was sent to the Ministers in Great Britain,
France, Russia, Prussia, Austria, Belgium, Italy, and Denmark; and
on May 10 to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Having received this instruction, Adams, at the close of his
first meeting with Russell on May 18, after having <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_142"></a>[V1:pg 142]</span> developed at
length the American position relative to the issue of the British
Proclamation of Neutrality, briefly added that he was directed to
offer adherence by means of a convention, to the Declaration of
Paris. Russell replied that Great Britain was willing to negotiate,
but "seemed to desire to leave the subject in the hands of Lord
Lyons, to whom he intimated that he had already transmitted
authority<a name="FNanchor242"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_242">[242]</a>...." Adams therefore did not press the
matter, waiting further information and instruction from
Washington. Nearly two weeks earlier Russell had, in fact,
approached the Government of France with a suggestion that the two
leading maritime powers should propose to the American belligerents
adherence to the second and third articles of the Declaration of
Paris. France had agreed and the date of Russell's instruction to
Lyons was May 18, the day of the interview with Adams. Confusion
now arose in both London and Washington as to the place where the
arrangement was to be concluded. The causes of this confusion will
be considered later in this chapter; here it is sufficient to note
that the negotiation was finally undertaken at London.</p>
<p>On July 18 Russell informed Adams that Great Britain was ready
to enter into a convention with the United States, provided a
similar convention was signed with France at the same time. This
convention, as submitted by Adams, simply recorded an agreement by
the two powers to abide by the four points of the Declaration of
Paris, using the exact wording of that document<a name=
"FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243">[243]</a>. Adams' draft
had been communicated to Russell on July 13. There then followed a
delay required by the necessity of securing similar action by
Dayton, the American Minister at Paris, but on July 29 Adams
reported to Russell that this had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_143"></a>[V1:pg 143]</span> been done and that he was ready
to sign. Two days later, July 31, Russell replied that he, also,
was ready, but concluded his letter, "I need scarcely add that on
the part of Great Britain the engagement will be prospective, and
will not invalidate anything already done<a name=
"FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244">[244]</a>." It was not
until August 8, however, that Cowley, the British Ambassador to
France, reported that Dayton had informed Thouvenel, French Foreign
Minister, that he was ready to sign the similar convention with
France<a name="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245">[245]</a>.
With no understanding, apparently, of the causes of further delay,
and professing complete ignorance of the meaning of Russell's
phrase, just quoted<a name="FNanchor246"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_246">[246]</a>, Adams waited the expected invitation to
an official interview for the affixing of signatures. Since it was
a condition of the negotiation that this should be done
simultaneously in London and Paris, the further delay that now
occurred caused him no misgivings.</p>
<p>On August 19 Russell requested Adams to name a convenient day
"in the course of this week," and prefaced this request with the
statement that he enclosed a copy of a Declaration which he
proposed to make in writing, upon signing the convention. "You will
observe," he wrote, "that it is intended to prevent any
misconception as to the nature of the engagement to be taken by Her
Majesty." The proposed Declaration read:</p>
<blockquote>"In affixing his signature to the Convention of this
day between Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and
the United States of America, the Earl Russell declares, by order
of Her Majesty, that Her Majesty does not intend thereby to
undertake any engagement which shall have any bearing, direct or
indirect, on the internal differences now prevailing in the United
States<a name="FNanchor247"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_247">[247]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"></a>[V1:pg 144]</span>
<p>Under his instructions to negotiate a convention for a pure and
simple adherence to the Declaration of Paris, Adams could not now
go on to official signature. Nor was he inclined to do so.
Sincerely believing, as he stated to Russell in a communication of
August 23, that the United States was "acting with the single
purpose of aiding to establish a permanent doctrine for all time,"
and with the object of "ameliorating the horrors of warfare all
over the globe," he objected "to accompany the act with a
proceeding somewhat novel and anomalous," which on the face of it
seemed to imply a suspicion on the part of Great Britain that the
United States was "desirous at this time to take a part in the
Declaration [of Paris], not from any high purpose or durable
policy, but with the view of securing some small temporary object
in the unhappy struggle which is going on at home<a name=
"FNanchor248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248">[248]</a>." He also
pointed out that Russell's proposed declaration either was or was
not a part of the convention. If it was a part then the Senate of
the United States must ratify it as well as the convention itself,
and he would have gone beyond his instructions in submitting it. If
not a part of the convention there could be no advantage in making
the Declaration since, unratified by the Senate, it would have no
force. Adams therefore declined to proceed further with the matter
until he had received new instructions from Washington.</p>
<p>To this Russell answered, August 28, with a very explicit
exposition of his reasons. Great Britain, he said, had declared her
neutrality in the American conflict, thereby recognizing the
belligerent rights of the South. It followed that the South "might
by the law of nations arm privateers," and that these "must be
regarded as the armed vessels of a belligerent." But the United
States had refused to recognize the status of belligerency, and
could therefore maintain that privateers issued by the Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145"></a>[V1:pg 145]</span>
States were in fact pirates, and might argue that a European Power
signing a convention with the United States, embodying the
principles of the Declaration of Paris, "would be bound to treat
the privateers of the so-called Confederate States as pirates."
Hence Russell pointed out, the two countries, arguing from
contradictory premises as to the status of the conflict in America,
might become involved in charges of bad faith and of violation of
the convention. He had therefore merely intended by his suggested
declaration to prevent any misconception by the United States.</p>
<blockquote>"It is in this spirit that Her Majesty's Government
decline to bind themselves, without a clear explanation on their
part, to a Convention which, seemingly confined to an adoption of
the Declaration of Paris of 1856, might be construed as an
engagement to interfere in the unhappy dissensions now prevailing
in the United States; an interference which would be contrary to
Her Majesty's public declarations, and would be a reversal of the
policy which Her Majesty has deliberately sanctioned<a name=
"FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249">[249]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thus the negotiation closed. Seward in declining to accept the
proposed declaration gave varying reasons in his instructions to
Adams, in London, and to Dayton, in Paris, for an exactly similar
declaration had been insisted upon by France, but he did not argue
the question save in generalities. He told Dayton that the supposed
possible "intervention" which Great Britain and France seemed to
fear they would be called upon to make was exactly the action which
the United States desired to forestall, and he notified Adams that
he could not consent since the proposed Declaration "would be
virtually a new and distinct article incorporated into the
projected convention<a name="FNanchor250"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_250">[250]</a>." The first formal negotiation of the
United States during the Civil War, and of the new American
Minister in London, had come <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_146"></a>[V1:pg 146]</span> to an inglorious conclusion.
Diplomats and Foreign Secretaries were, quite naturally, disturbed,
and were even suspicious of each others' motives, but the public,
not at the moment informed save on the American offer and the
result, paid little attention to these "inner circle"
controversies<a name="FNanchor251"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_251">[251]</a>.</p>
<p>What then were the hidden purposes, if such existed, of the
negotiating powers. The first answer in historical writing was that
offered by Henry Adams<a name="FNanchor252"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_252">[252]</a>, in an essay entitled "The Declaration of
Paris, 1861," in the preparation of which the author studied with
care all the diplomatic correspondence available in print<a name=
"FNanchor253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253">[253]</a>. His treatment
presents Russell as engaged in a policy of deception with the view
of obtaining an ultimate advantage to Great Britain in the field of
commercial rivalry and maritime supremacy. Following Henry Adams'
argument Russell, on May 9, brought to the attention of France a
proposal for a joint request on the American belligerents to
respect the second and third articles of the Declaration of Paris,
and received an acquiescent reply. After some further exchanges of
proposed terms of instructions to the British and French Ministers
at Washington, Russell, on May 18, sent a despatch to Lyons with
instructions for his action. On this same day Russell, in his first
interview with Adams, "before these despatches [to Lyons] could
have left the Foreign Office," and replying to Adams' proposal to
negotiate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147"></a>[V1:pg
147]</span> on the Declaration of Paris as a <i>whole</i>--that is
to say, on all four articles--intimated that instructions had
already gone to Lyons, with directions to assent to any
modification of the article on privateering that the United States
might desire. Adams understood Russell to prefer that the
negotiation (for such Adams thought it was to be) should take place
in Washington, and did not press the matter.</p>
<p>This was deliberate deceit; first in a statement of fact since
the interview with Adams took place at noon on May 18, at Russell's
country house nine miles from London, and in all reasonable
supposition the despatch to Lyons would not have been sent until
the Foreign Secretary's return to his office; second because Lyons
was not instructed to <i>negotiate</i> on the Declaration. The
interpretation is justified therefore that Russell "evaded the
offer of the United States Government." The result of this evasion
was delay, but when Seward learned from Lyons that he had no
authority to negotiate a convention and Adams received renewed
instructions to proceed, the latter "kept his temper, but the
affair made a lasting impression on his mind, and shook his faith
in the straightforwardness of the British Government." In renewing
his overtures at London, Adams made explanations of the previous
"misunderstanding" and to these Russell replied with further
"inaccuracies" as to what had been said at the first interview.</p>
<p>Thus beginning his survey with an assertion of British deceit
and evasion from the very outset, and incidentally remarking that
Lyons, at Washington, "made little disguise of his leanings" toward
the South, Henry Adams depicts Russell as leading France along a
line of policy distinctly unfriendly to the North. Examining each
point in the negotiation as already narrated, he summarized it as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The story has shown that Russell and his colleagues
... induced the French Government to violate the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_148"></a>[V1:pg 148]</span> pledge in the
protocol of the Declaration of Paris in order to offer to both
belligerents a partial adhesion, which must exclude the United
States from a simple adhesion, to the Declaration of Paris, while
it placed both belligerents on the same apparent footing. These
steps were taken in haste before Adams could obtain an interview.
When Adams by an effort unexpected to Russell obtained an interview
at Pembroke Lodge at noon of Saturday, May 18, and according to
Russell's report of May 21, said that the United States were
'disposed to adhere to the Declaration of Paris,' Russell evaded
the offer, saying that he had already sent sufficient instructions
to Lyons, although the instructions were not sufficient, nor had
they been sent. When this evasion was afterward brought to his
notice by Adams, Russell, revising his report to Lyons, made such
changes in it as should represent the first proposal as coming from
himself, and the evasion to have come from Adams. When at last
obliged to read the American offer, Russell declared that he had
never heard of it before, although he had himself reported it to
Lyons and Lyons had reported it to him. When compelled to take the
offer for consideration, Russell, though always professing to
welcome adhesion pure and simple, required the co-operation of
Dayton. When Adams overcame this last obstacle, Russell interposed
a written proviso, which as he knew from Lyons would prevent
ratification. When Adams paid no attention to the proviso but
insisted on signature of the treaty, Russell at last wrote a
declaration in the nature of an insult, which could not be
disregarded<a name="FNanchor254"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_254">[254]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In this presentation of the case to the jury certain minor
points are insisted upon to establish a ground for suspicion--as
the question of who first made the proposal--that are not essential
to Henry Adams' conclusions. This conclusion is that "From the
delays interposed by Russell, Adams must conclude that the British
Cabinet was trying one device after another to evade the
proposition; and finally, from the written declaration of August
19, he could draw no other inference than that Russell had resorted
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"></a>[V1:pg 149]</span>
the only defensive weapon left to him, in order to avoid the avowal
of his true motives and policy<a name="FNanchor255"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_255">[255]</a>." The <i>motive</i> of this tortuous
proceeding, the author believed to have been a deep-laid scheme to
revive, <i>after</i> the American War was ended, the earlier
international practice of Great Britain, in treating as subject to
belligerent seizure enemy's goods under the neutral flag. It was
the American stand, argues Henry Adams, that in 1854 had compelled
Great Britain to renounce this practice. A complete American
adherence, now, to the Declaration, would for ever tie Britain's
hands, but if there were no such complete adherence and only
temporary observation of the second article, after the war had
resulted in the disruption of the United States, thus removing the
chief supporter of that article, Great Britain would feel free to
resume her old-time practice when she engaged in war. If Great
Britain made a formal treaty with the United States she would feel
bound to respect it; the Declaration of Paris as it stood
constituted "a mere agreement, which was binding, as Lord
Malmesbury declared, only so long as it was convenient to respect
it<a name="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256">[256]</a>."
Thus the second article of the Declaration of Paris, not the first
on privateering, was in the eye of the British Cabinet in the
negotiation of 1861. Henry Adams ends his essay: "After the manner
in which Russell received the advances of President Lincoln, no
American Minister in London could safely act on any other
assumption than that the British Government meant, at the first
convenient opportunity, to revive the belligerent pretensions
dormant since the War of 1812<a name="FNanchor257"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_257">[257]</a>."</p>
<p>This analysis was published in 1891. Still more briefly
summarized it depicts an unfriendly, almost hostile attitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"></a>[V1:pg 150]</span> on
the part of Russell and Lyons, deceit and evasion by the former,
selfish British policy, and throughout a blind following on by
France, yielding to Russell's leadership. The American proposal is
regarded merely as a simple and sincere offer to join in supporting
an improved international practice in war-times. But when Frederic
Bancroft, the biographer of Seward, examined the negotiation he was
compelled to ask himself whether this was all, indeed, that the
American Secretary of State had in view. Bancroft's analysis may be
stated more briefly<a name="FNanchor258"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_258">[258]</a>.</p>
<p>Seward's general instruction, Bancroft notes, bore date of April
24, nearly a month before any foreign Power had recognized Southern
belligerent rights; it indicates "a plan by which he hoped to
remove all excuse for such action." In despatches to Dayton, Seward
asserted a twofold motive: "a sincere desire to co-operate with
other progressive nations in the melioration of the rigours of
maritime war," and "to remove every cause that any foreign Power
could have for the recognition of the insurgents as a belligerent
Power<a name="FNanchor259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259">[259]</a>."
This last result was not so clear to Dayton at Paris, nor was the
mechanism of operation ever openly stated by Seward. But he did
write, later, that the proposal of accession to the Declaration of
Paris was tendered "as the act of this Federal Government, to be
obligatory equally upon disloyal as upon loyal citizens." "It did
not," writes Bancroft, "require the gift of prophecy to tell what
would result in case the offer of accession on the part of the
United States should be accepted<a name="FNanchor260"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_260">[260]</a>."</p>
<p>Seward's object was to place the European nations in a position
where they, as well as the United States, would be forced to regard
Southern privateers as pirates, and treat <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_151"></a>[V1:pg 151]</span> them as such.
This was a conceivable result of the negotiation before European
recognition of Southern belligerency, but even after that
recognition and after Dayton had pointed out the impossibility of
such a result, Seward pressed for the treaty and instructed Dayton
not to raise the question with France. He still had in mind this
main object. "If Seward," says Bancroft, "had not intended to use
the adherence of the United States to the declaration as a lever to
force the other Powers to treat the Confederates as pirates, or at
least to cease regarding them as belligerents, he might easily and
unofficially have removed all such suspicions<a name=
"FNanchor261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261">[261]</a>." In an
interview with Lyons on July 6 Seward urged a quick conclusion of
the treaty, arguing that its effect upon the revolted states could
be determined afterwards. Naturally Lyons was alarmed and gave
warning to Russell. "Probably it was this advice that caused
Russell to insist on the explanatory declaration<a name=
"FNanchor262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262">[262]</a>."</p>
<p>It would appear, then, that Seward much underestimated the
acuteness of Russell and Thouvenel, and expected them "to walk into
a trap." Nor could his claim "that there was no difference between
a nation entirely at peace and one in circumstances like those of
the United States at this time" be taken seriously. "He was
furnishing his opponent with evidences of his lack of candour."
This clouded the effect that would have followed "a wise and
generous policy toward neutrals, which had doubtless been in
Seward's mind from the beginning<a name="FNanchor263"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_263">[263]</a>." In the end he concluded the negotiation
gracefully, writing to Adams a pledge of American respect for the
second and third articles of the Declaration of Paris--exactly that
which Lyons had originally been instructed by Russell to
secure.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"></a>[V1:pg 152]</span>
<blockquote>"We regard Great Britain as a friend. Her Majesty's
flag, according to our traditional principles, covers enemy's goods
not contraband of war. Goods of Her Majesty's subjects, not
contraband of war, are exempt from confiscation, though found under
a neutral or disloyal flag. No depredations shall be committed by
our naval forces or by those of any of our citizens, so far as we
can prevent it, upon the vessels or property of British subjects.
Our blockade, being effective, must be respected<a name=
"FNanchor264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264">[264]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thus Bancroft regards Seward's proposals of April 24 as in part
the result of humanitarian motives and in part as having a
concealed purpose of Northern advantage. This last he calls a
"trap." And it is to be noted that in Seward's final pledge to
Adams the phrase "those of any of our citizens" reserves, for the
North, since the negotiation had failed, the right to issue
privateers on her own account. But Russell also, says Bancroft, was
not "altogether artless and frank." He had in view a British
commercial advantage during the war, since if the United States
respected the second and third articles of the Declaration of
Paris, and "if Confederate privateers should roam the ocean and
seize the ships and goods of citizens of the North, all the better
for other commercial nations; for it would soon cause the commerce
of the United States to be carried on under foreign flags,
especially the British and French<a name="FNanchor265"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_265">[265]</a>." Ulterior motive is, therefore, ascribed
to both parties in the negotiation, and that of Seward is treated
as conceived at the moment when a policy of seeking European
friendship was dominant at Washington, but with the hope of
securing at least negative European support. Seward's persistence
after European recognition of Southern belligerency is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_153"></a>[V1:pg 153]</span> regarded as a
characteristic obstinacy without a clear view of possible resulting
dangerous complications.</p>
<p>This view discredits the acumen of the American Secretary of
State and it does not completely satisfy the third historian to
examine the incident in detail. Nor does he agree on the basis of
British policy. Charles Francis Adams, in his "Life" of his father,
writing in 1899, followed in the main the view of his brother,
Henry Adams. But in 1912 he reviewed the negotiation at great
length with different conclusions<a name="FNanchor266"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_266">[266]</a>. His thesis is that the Declaration of
Paris negotiation was an essential part of Seward's "foreign war
policy," in that in case a treaty was signed with Great Britain and
France and then those Powers refused to aid in the suppression of
Southern privateering, or at least permitted them access to British
and French ports, a good ground of complaint leading to war would
be established. <i>This</i> was the ultimate ulterior purpose in
Seward's mind; the negotiation was but a method of fixing a quarrel
on some foreign Power in case the United States should seek, as
Seward desired, a cementing of the rift at home by a foreign
war.</p>
<p>In the details of the negotiation C.F. Adams agrees with
Bancroft, but with this new interpretation. The opening
misunderstanding he ascribed, as did Lyons, to the simple fact that
Seward "had refused to see the despatch" in which Russell's
proposals were made<a name="FNanchor267"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_267">[267]</a>. Seward's instructions <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_154"></a>[V1:pg 154]</span> of July 6,
after the misunderstanding was made clear to him, pushing the
negotiation, were drawn when he was "still riding a very high
horse--the No. 10 charger, in fact, he had mounted on the 21st of
the previous May<a name="FNanchor268"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_268">[268]</a>," and this warlike charger he continued
to ride until the sobering Northern defeat at Bull Run, July 21,
put an end to his folly. If that battle had been a Northern victory
he would have gone on with his project. Now, with the end of a
period of brain-storm and the emergence of sanity in foreign
policy, "Secretary Seward in due time (September 7) pronounced the
proposed reservation [by Russell] quite 'inadmissible.' And here
the curtain fell on this somewhat prolonged and not altogether
creditable diplomatic farce<a name="FNanchor269"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_269">[269]</a>."</p>
<p>Incidentally C.F. Adams examined also British action and
intention. Lyons is wholly exonerated. "Of him it may be fairly
said that his course throughout seems to furnish no ground for
criticism<a name="FNanchor270"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_270">[270]</a>." And Lyons is quoted as having
understood, in the end, the real purpose of Seward's policy in
seeking embroilment with Europe. He wrote to Russell on December 6
upon the American publication of despatches, accompanying the
President's annual message: "Little doubt can remain, after reading
the papers, that the accession was offered solely with the view to
the effect it would have on the privateering operations of the
Southern States; and that a refusal on the part of England and
France, after having accepted the accession, to treat the Southern
privateers as pirates, would have been made a serious grievance, if
not a ground of quarrel<a name="FNanchor271"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_271">[271]</a>...." As to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_155"></a>[V1:pg 155]</span> Russell, combating Henry Adams'
view, it is asserted that it was the great good fortune of the
United States that the British Foreign Secretary, having declared a
policy of neutrality, was not to be driven from its honest
application by irritations, nor seduced into a position where the
continuation of that policy would be difficult.</p>
<p>Before entering upon an account of the bearing of the newly
available British materials on the negotiation--materials which
will in themselves offer sufficient comment on the theories of
Henry Adams, and in less degree of Bancroft--it is best to note
here the fallacy in C.F. Adams' main thesis. If the analysis given
in the preceding chapter of the initiation and duration of Seward's
"foreign war policy" is correct, then the Declaration of Paris
negotiation had no essential relation whatever to that policy. The
instructions to Adams were sent to eight other Ministers. Is it
conceivable that Seward desired a war with the whole maritime
world? The date, April 24, antedates any deliberate proposal of a
foreign war, whatever he may have been brooding, and in fact stamps
the offer as part of that friendly policy toward Europe which
Lincoln had insisted upon. Seward's frenzy for a foreign war did
not come to a head until the news had been received of England's
determination to recognize Southern belligerency. This was in the
second week of May and on the twenty-first Despatch No. 10 marked
the decline, not the beginning, of a belligerent policy, and by the
President's orders. By May 24 probably, by the twenty-seventh
certainly, Seward had yielded and was rapidly beginning to turn to
expressions of friendship<a name="FNanchor272"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_272">[272]</a>. Yet it was only on May 18 that Russell's
first instructions to Lyons were sent, and not until late in June
that the "misunderstanding" cleared away, instructions were
despatched by Seward to push the Declaration of Paris negotiations
at London and Paris. The battle of Bull Run <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_156"></a>[V1:pg 156]</span> had nothing to
do with a new policy. Thus chronology forbids the inclusion of this
negotiation, either in its inception, progress, or conclusion, as
an agency intended to make possible, on just grounds, a foreign
war.</p>
<p>A mere chronological examination of documents, both printed and
in archives, permits a clearer view of British policy on the
Declaration of Paris. Recalling the facts of the American situation
known in London it will be remembered that on May 1 the British
Government and Parliament became aware that a civil war was
inevitable and that the South planned to issue privateers. On that
day Russell asked the Admiralty to reinforce the British fleet in
West Indian waters that British commerce might be adequately
protected. Five days later, May 6, he announced in the Commons that
Great Britain must be strictly neutral, and that a policy of close
harmony with France was being matured; and on this day he proposed
through Cowley, in Paris, that Great Britain and France each ask
<i>both</i> the contending parties in America to abide by the
second and third articles of the Declaration of Paris<a name=
"FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273">[273]</a>. If there was
ulterior motive here it does not appear in any despatch either then
or later, passing between any of the British diplomats
concerned--Russell, Cowley, and Lyons. The plain fact was that the
United States was not an adherent to the Declaration, that the
South had announced privateering, and the North a blockade, and
that the only portions of the Declaration in regard to which the
belligerents had as yet made no statement were the second and third
articles.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"></a>[V1:pg 157]</span>
<p>It was, indeed, an anxious time for the British Government. On
May 9 Forster asked in the Commons what would be the Government's
attitude toward a British subject serving on a Southern
privateer<a name="FNanchor274"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_274">[274]</a>. The next day in the Lords there occurred
a debate the general burden of which was that privateering was in
fact piracy, but that under the conditions of the American previous
stand, it could not be treated as such<a name=
"FNanchor275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275">[275]</a>. Both in the
Commons and the Lords speakers were referred to the forthcoming
Proclamation of Neutrality, but the uncertainty developed in both
debates is very probably reflected in the new despatch now sent to
Cowley, on May 11<a name="FNanchor276"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_276">[276]</a>. By that despatch France was asked to
send an instruction to Mercier in Washington similar to a draft
instruction intended for Lyons, a copy of which was enclosed to
Cowley, the object being to secure from the American belligerents
adherence to <i>all</i> the articles, privateering included, of the
Declaration of Paris<a name="FNanchor277"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_277">[277]</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever Russell's purpose in thus altering his original
suggestion, it met with a prompt check from France. On May 9
Thouvenel had agreed heartily to the proposal of May 6, adding the
practical advice that the best method of approach to the
Confederacy would be through the consuls in the South<a name=
"FNanchor278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278">[278]</a>. Now, on May
13, Russell was informed that Thouvenel feared that England and
France would get into serious trouble if the North agreed to accede
on privateering and the South did not. Cowley reported that he had
argued with Thouvenel that privateers were <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_158"></a>[V1:pg 158]</span> pirates and
ought to be treated as such, but that Thouvenel refused to do more
than instruct Mercier on the second and third articles<a name=
"FNanchor279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279">[279]</a>. For the moment
Russell appears to have yielded easily to this French advice. On
May 13 he had that interview with the Southern commissioners in
which he mentioned a communication about to be made to the
South<a name="FNanchor280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280">[280]</a>;
and on May 15 the London <i>Times</i>, presumably reflecting
governmental decision, in commenting on the Proclamation of
Neutrality, developed at some length the idea that British
citizens, if they served on Southern privateers, could claim no
protection from Great Britain if the North chose to treat them as
pirates. May 16, Cowley reported that Thouvenel had written Mercier
in the terms of Russell's draft to Lyons of the eleventh, but
omitting the part about privateering<a name=
"FNanchor281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281">[281]</a>, and on this
same day Russell sent to Cowley a copy of a <i>new</i> draft of
instructions to Lyons, seemingly in exact accord with the French
idea<a name="FNanchor282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282">[282]</a>. On
the seventeenth, Cowley reported this as highly satisfactory to
Thouvenel<a name="FNanchor283"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_283">[283]</a>. Finally on May 18 the completed
instruction was despatched.</p>
<p>It was on this same day, May 18, that Adams had his first
interview with Russell. All that had been planned by Great Britain
and France had been based on their estimate of the necessity of the
situation. They had no knowledge of Seward's instructions of April
24. When therefore Adams, toward the conclusion of his interview,
stated his authority to negotiate a convention, he undoubtedly took
Russell by surprise. So far as he was concerned a suggestion to the
North, the result of an agreement made with France <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_159"></a>[V1:pg 159]</span> after some
discussion and delay, was in fact completed, and the draft finally
drawn <i>two days before</i>, on the sixteenth. Even if not
actually sent, as Henry Adams thinks, it was a completed agreement.
Russell might well speak of it as an instruction already given to
Lyons. Moreover there were two points in Adams' conversation of the
eighteenth likely to give Russell cause for thought. The first was
Adams' protest against the British recognition of a status of
belligerency. If the North felt so earnestly about this, had it
been wise to instruct Lyons to make an approach to the South? This
required consideration. And in the second place did not Adams'
offer again open up the prospect of somehow getting from the North
at least a formal and permanent renunciation of privateering?</p>
<p>For if an examination is made of Russell's instruction to Lyons
of May 18 it appears that he had not, after all, dropped that
reference to privateering which Thouvenel had omitted in his own
instructions to Mercier. Adams understood Russell to have said that
he "had already transmitted authority [to Lyons] to assent to any
modification of the only point in issue which the Government of the
United States might prefer. On that matter he believed that there
would be no difficulty whatever<a name="FNanchor284"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_284">[284]</a>." This clearly referred to privateering.
Russell's instructions to Lyons took up the points of the
Declaration of Paris in reverse order. That on blockades was now
generally accepted by all nations. The principle of the third
article had "long been recognized as law, both in Great Britain and
in the United States." The second article, "sanctioned by the
United States in the earliest period of the history of their
independence," had been opposed, formerly, by Great Britain, but
having acquiesced in the Declaration of 1856, "she means to adhere
to the principle she then adopted." <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_160"></a>[V1:pg 160]</span> Thus briefly stating his
confidence that the United States would agree on three of the
articles, Russell explained at length his views as to privateering
in the American crisis.</p>
<blockquote>"There remains only to be considered Article I, namely,
that relating to privateering, from which the Government of the
United States withheld their assent. Under these circumstances it
is expedient to consider what is required on this subject by the
general law of nations. Now it must be borne in mind that
privateers bearing the flag of one or other of the belligerents may
be manned by lawless and abandoned men, who may commit, for the
sake of plunder, the most destructive and sanguinary outrages.
There can be no question, however, but that the commander and crew
of a ship bearing a letter of marque must, by the law of nations,
carry on their hostilities according to the established laws of
war. Her Majesty's Government must, therefore, hold any Government
issuing such letters of marque responsible for, and liable to make
good, any losses sustained by Her Majesty's subjects in consequence
of wrongful proceedings of vessels sailing under such letters of
marque.<br>
<br>
"In this way, the object of the Declaration of Paris may to a
certain extent be attained without the adoption of any new
principle.<br>
<br>
"You will urge these points upon Mr. Seward<a name=
"FNanchor285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285">[285]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>What did Russell mean by this cautious statement? The facts
known to him were that Davis had proclaimed the issue of letters of
marque and that Lincoln had countered by proclaiming Southern
privateering to be piracy<a name="FNanchor286"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_286">[286]</a>. He did not know that Seward was prepared
to renounce privateering, but he must have thought it likely from
Lincoln's proclamation, and have regarded this as a good time to
strike for an object desired by all the European maritime nations
since 1856. Russell could not, while Great Britain was neutral,
join the United States in treating Southern privateers as pirates,
but he here offered to come as close <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_161"></a>[V1:pg 161]</span> to it as he dared, by asserting
that Great Britain would use vigilance in upholding the law of
nations. This language might be interpreted as intended for the
admonition of the North also, but the <i>facts</i> of the then
known situation make it applicable to Southern activities alone.
Russell had desired to include privateering in the proposals to the
United States and to the South, but Thouvenel's criticisms forced
him to a half-measure of suggestion to the North, and a full
statement of the delicacy of the situation in the less formal
letter to Lyons accompanying his official instructions. This was
also dated May 18. In it Russell directed Lyons to transmit to the
British Consul at Charleston or New Orleans a copy of the official
instruction "to be communicated at Montgomery to the President of
the so-styled Confederate States," and he further explained his
purpose and the British position:</p>
<blockquote>"... You will not err in encouraging the Government to
which you are accredited to carry into effect any disposition which
they may evince to recognize the Declaration of Paris in regard to
privateering....<br>
<br>
"You will clearly understand that Her Majesty's Government cannot
accept the renunciation of privateering on the part of the
Government of the United States if coupled with the condition that
they should enforce its renunciation on the Confederate States,
either by denying their right to issue letters of marque, or by
interfering with the belligerent operations of vessels holding from
them such letters of marque, so long as they carry on hostilities
according to the recognized principles and under the admitted
liabilities of the law of nations<a name="FNanchor287"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_287">[287]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Certainly this was clear enough and was demanded by the British
policy of neutrality. Russell had guarded against the complication
feared by Thouvenel, but he still hoped by a half-pledge to the
North and a half-threat to the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_162"></a>[V1:pg 162]</span> South to secure from both
belligerents a renunciation of privateering. In short he was not
yet fully convinced of the wisdom of the French limitation.
Moreover he believed that Thouvenel might yet be won to his own
opinion, for in an unprinted portion of this same private letter to
Lyons of May 18 Russell wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"I have further to state to you, with reference to my
despatch of this day that H.M. Govt. were in the first instance
inclined to propose to both of the contending parties to adopt the
first clause of the Declaration of Paris, by which privateering is
renounced. But after communication with the French Govt. it
appeared best to limit our propositions in the manner explained in
my despatch.<br>
<br>
"I understand however from Lord Cowley that, although M. Mercier is
not absolutely instructed to advert to the abolition of
privateering, yet that some latitude of action is left to him on
that point should he deem it advisable to exercise it<a name=
"FNanchor288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288">[288]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lyons and Mercier saw more clearly than did Russell what was in
Seward's mind. Lyons had been instructed in the despatch just cited
to use his own discretion as to joint action with the French
Minister so long only as the two countries took the same stand. He
was to pursue whatever method seemed most "conciliatory." His first
private comment on receiving Russell's instruction was, "Mr. Seward
will be furious when he finds that his adherence to the Declaration
of Paris will not stop the Southern privateering<a name=
"FNanchor289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289">[289]</a>," and in an
official confidential despatch of the same day, June 4, he gave
Russell clear warning of what Seward expected from his overture
through Adams<a name="FNanchor290"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_290">[290]</a>. So delicate did the matter appear to
Lyons and Mercier that <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_163"></a>[V1:pg 163]</span> they agreed to keep quiet for a
time at least about their instructions, hoping to be relieved by
the transfer of the whole matter to London and Paris<a name=
"FNanchor291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291">[291]</a>. But in London
Russell was at this moment taking up again his favoured purpose. On
June 6 he wrote to Grey (temporarily replacing Cowley at Paris)
that he understood a communication had been made in Paris, as in
London, for an American adherence to the Declaration of Paris; "...
it may open the way to the abolition of Privateering all over the
world. But ... we ought not to use any menace to the Confederate
States with a view of obtaining this desirable object<a name=
"FNanchor292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292">[292]</a>." Evidently, in
his opinion, the South would not dare to hold out and no "menace"
would be required<a name="FNanchor293"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_293">[293]</a>. Six days later, however, having learned
from the French Ambassador that Dayton in Paris had made clear to
Thouvenel the expectation of the United States that France would
treat Southern privateers as pirates, Russell wrote that England,
of course, could not agree to any such conclusion<a name=
"FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294">[294]</a>. Nevertheless
this did not mean that Russell yet saw any real objection to
concluding a convention with the United States. Apparently he could
not believe that so obvious an inconsistency <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_164"></a>[V1:pg 164]</span> with the
declared neutrality of Great Britain was expected to be obtained by
the American Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Others were more suspicious. Lyons reported on June 13 that
Seward had specifically informed Mercier of his belief that a
convention signed would bind England and France to aid in
suppressing Southern privateering<a name="FNanchor295"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_295">[295]</a>. The effect of this on Lyons and Mercier
was to impress upon them the advisability of an <i>official</i>
notification to Seward, of English and French neutrality--a step
not yet taken and which was still postponed, awaiting further
instructions<a name="FNanchor296"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_296">[296]</a>. On June 15 the two Ministers finally
concluded they could no longer delay and made that joint visit to
Seward which resulted in his refusal to receive them as acting
together, or to receive officially their instructions, though he
read these for his private information. The remainder of June was
spent by Lyons in attempting to put matters on a more formal basis,
yet not pushing them unduly for fear of arousing Seward's anger.
June 17, Lyons told Seward, privately, and alone, that Great
Britain <i>must</i> have some intercourse with the South if only
for the protection of British interests. Seward's reply was that
the United States might "shut its eyes" to this, but that if
notified of what England and France were doing, the United States
would be compelled to make protest. Lyons thereupon urged Seward to
distinguish between his official and personal knowledge, but Lyons
and Mercier again postponed beginning the negotiation with the
Confederacy<a name="FNanchor297"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_297">[297]</a>. Yet while thus reporting this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165"></a>[V1:pg 165]</span>
postponement in one letter, Lyons, in another letter of the same
date, indicated that the two Ministers thought that they had found
a solution of the problem of how to approach, yet not negotiate
with, the Confederacy. The idea was Mercier's. Their consuls in the
South were to be instructed to go, not to the Southern President,
but to the Governor of the State selected, thus avoiding any
overture to the Confederate Government<a name=
"FNanchor298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298">[298]</a>. Even with this
solution possible they still hesitated, feeling as Lyons wrote "a
little pusillanimous," but believing they had prevented an
explosion<a name="FNanchor299"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_299">[299]</a>. Moreover Lyons was a bit uneasy because
of an important difference, so it seemed to him, in his formal
instructions and those of Mercier. The latter had no orders, as had
Lyons, to notify Seward, if the agreement on maritime law was made
in Washington, that such agreement would not affect the belligerent
right of the South to issue privateers<a name=
"FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300">[300]</a>. Apparently
Mercier had been given no instructions to make this clear--let
alone any "latitude" to deal with privateering--although, as a
matter of fact, he had already given Seward his personal opinion in
accord with Lyons' instructions; but this was not an official
French stand. Lyons was therefore greatly relieved, the
"misunderstanding" now cleared away, that new instructions were
being sent to Adams to go on with the convention in London. His
only subsequent comment of moment was sent to Russell on July 8,
when he learned from Seward that Dayton, in Paris, had been
directed to raise no further question as to what would or would not
be demanded of France in case a convention were signed for an
American adherence to the Declaration of Paris. Lyons now repeated
his former advice that under no circumstances should a convention
be signed without a distinct declaration of no <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_166"></a>[V1:pg 166]</span> British
responsibility or duty as regards Southern privateers<a name=
"FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301">[301]</a>.</p>
<p>The entire matter was now transferred to London and Paris.
Lyons' report of the misunderstanding and that new instructions
were being sent to Adams was received on June 30. Russell replied
to Lyons on July 5 that Adams had "never made any proposition" on
the Declaration of Paris, and that he would now await one<a name=
"FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302">[302]</a>. July 11, Adams
made his formal offer to sign a convention and communicated a draft
of it on the thirteenth. On the day intervening, the twelfth,
Russell took a very important step indicative of his sincerity
throughout, of his lack of any ulterior motive, and of his anxiety
to carry through the negotiation with no resulting irritations or
complications with the United States. He recalled his instructions
to Lyons about communicating with the Confederacy, stating that in
any case he had never intended that Lyons should act without first
officially notifying Seward. This recall was now made, he wrote,
because to go on might "create fresh irritation without any
adequate result," but if in the meantime Lyons had already started
negotiations with the South he might "proceed in them to the
end<a name="FNanchor303"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_303">[303]</a>."</p>
<p>Having taken this step in the hope that it might avert friction
with the United States, Russell, now distinctly eager to secure
American adherence to the Declaration in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_167"></a>[V1:pg 167]</span> full, was ready
to conclude the convention at once. The warnings received from many
sources did not dismay him. He probably thought that no actual
difficulties would ensue, believing that the South would not
venture to continue privateering. Even if France were disinclined
to make a convention he appears to have been ready for signature by
Great Britain alone, for on July 15 he telegraphed Cowley, "I
conclude there can be no objection to my signing a Convention with
the U.S. Minister giving the adherence of the U.S. to the
Declaration of Paris so far as concerns Gt. Britain. Answer
immediately by telegraph<a name="FNanchor304"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_304">[304]</a>." Cowley replied on the sixteenth that
Thouvenel could not object, but thought it a wrong move<a name=
"FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305">[305]</a>. Cowley in a
private letter of the same day thought that unless there were "very
cogent reasons for signing a Convention at once with Adams," it
would be better to wait until France could be brought in, and he
expressed again his fear of the danger involved in Adams'
proposal<a name="FNanchor306"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_306">[306]</a>. The same objection was promptly made by
Palmerston when shown the draft of a reply to Adams. Palmerston
suggested the insertion of a statement that while ready to sign a
convention Great Britain would do so only at the same time with
France<a name="FNanchor307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307">[307]</a>.
Thus advised Russell telegraphed in the late afternoon of the
sixteenth to Cowley that he would "wait for your despatches
to-morrow," and that no reply had yet been given Adams<a name=
"FNanchor308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308">[308]</a>, and on the
seventeenth he wrote enclosing a draft, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_168"></a>[V1:pg 168]</span> approved by
Palmerston and the Queen, stating that Great Britain had no desire
to act alone if Dayton really had instructions identical with those
of Adams. He added that if thought desirable Adams and Dayton might
be informed verbally, that the proposed Convention would in no way
alter the Proclamation of Neutrality<a name=
"FNanchor309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309">[309]</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining steps in the negotiation have already been
narrated<a name="FNanchor310"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_310">[310]</a>. Russell informed Adams of the
requirement of a similar French convention, Adams secured action by
Dayton, and in spite of continued French reluctance and
suspicion<a name="FNanchor311"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_311">[311]</a> all was ready in mid-August for the
affixing of signatures, when Russell, in execution of his previous
promise, and evidently now impressed with the need of an explicit
understanding, gave notice of his intended declaration in writing
to be attached to the convention<a name="FNanchor312"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_312">[312]</a>. On August 20 both Adams and Dayton
refused to sign, the former taking the ground, and with evident
sincerity, that the "exception" gave evidence of a British
suspicion that was insulting to his country, while Dayton had
"hardly concealed" from Thouvenel that this same "exception" was
the very object of the Convention<a name="FNanchor313"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_313">[313]</a>. While preparing his rejoinder to Adams'
complaint Russell wrote in a note to Palmerston "it all looks as if
a trap had been prepared<a name="FNanchor314"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_314">[314]</a>." He, too, at last, was forced to a
conclusion long since reached by every other diplomat, save Adams,
engaged in this negotiation.</p>
<p>But in reviewing the details of the entire affair it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"></a>[V1:pg 169]</span>
appear that in its initiation by Seward there is no proof that he
then thought of any definite "trap". April 24 antedated any
knowledge by Seward of British or French policy on neutrality, and
he was engaged in attempting to secure a friendly attitude by
foreign Powers. One means of doing this was by giving assurances on
maritime law in time of war. True he probably foresaw an advantage
through expected aid in repressing privateering, but primarily he
hoped to persuade the maritime Powers not to recognize Southern
belligerency. It was in fact this question of belligerency that
determined all his policy throughout the first six months of the
American conflict. He was obstinately determined to maintain that
no such status existed, and throughout the whole war he returned
again and again to pressure on foreign Powers to recall their
proclamations of neutrality. Refusing to recognize foreign
neutrality as final Seward persisted in this negotiation in the
hope that if completed it would place Great Britain and France in a
position where they would be forced to reconsider their declared
policy. A demand upon them to aid in suppressing privateering might
indeed then be used as an argument, but the object was not
privateering in itself; that object was the recall of the
recognition of Southern belligerency. In the end he simply could
not agree to the limiting declaration for it would have constituted
an acknowledgment by the United States itself of the existence of a
state of war.</p>
<p>In all of this Adams, seemingly, had no share. He acted on the
simple and straightforward theory that the United States, pursuing
a conciliatory policy, was now offering to adhere to international
rules advocated by all the maritime powers. As a result he felt
both personally and patriotically aggrieved that suspicion was
directed toward the American overtures<a name=
"FNanchor315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315">[315]</a>. For him the
failure of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170"></a>[V1:pg
170]</span> negotiation had temporarily, at least, an unfortunate
result: "So far as the assumed friendliness of Earl Russell to the
United States was concerned, the scales had fallen from his eyes.
His faith in the straightforwardness of any portion of the
Palmerston-Russell Ministry was gone<a name=
"FNanchor316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316">[316]</a>."</p>
<p>And for Russell also the affair spelled a certain
disillusionment, not, it is true, in the good faith of Adams, for
whom he still preserved a high regard. Russell felt that his policy
of a straightforward British neutrality, his quick acquiescence in
the blockade, even before actually effective, his early order
closing British ports to prizes of Confederate privateers<a name=
"FNanchor317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317">[317]</a>, were all
evidences of at least a friendly attitude toward the North. He may,
as did nearly every Englishman at the moment, think the re-union of
America impossible, but he had begun with the plan of strict
neutrality, and certainly with no thought of offensive action
against the North. His first thought in the Declaration of Paris
negotiation was to persuade both belligerents to acquiesce in a
portion of the rules of that Declaration, but almost at once he saw
the larger advantage to the world of a complete adherence by the
United States. This became Russell's fixed idea in which he
persisted against warnings and obstacles. Because of this he
attempted to recall the instruction to approach the South, was
ready even, until prohibited by Palmerston, to depart from a policy
of close joint action with France, and in the end was forced by
that prohibition to make a limiting declaration guarding British
neutrality. In it all there is no evidence of any hidden motive nor
of any other than a straightforward, even if obstinately blind,
procedure. The effect on Russell, at last grudgingly admitting that
there had been a "trap," <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_171"></a>[V1:pg 171]</span> was as unfortunate for good
understanding as in the case of Adams. He also was irritated,
suspicious, and soon less convinced that a policy of strict
neutrality could long be maintained<a name=

It is true that Seward had refused to receive officially this
despatch, but he had read and considered it in private. Hence he
knew <i>privately</i> the facts of Russell's proposal and that
Lyons had no instructions to negotiate. The incident of this
despatch has been treated by me in Chapter IV, where I regard
Seward's refusal to receive officially the despatch as primarily a
refusal to be notified of Great Britain's proclamation of
neutrality. Bancroft treats this incident as primarily a clever
refusal by Seward to be approached officially by Lyons and Mercier
in a joint representation, thus blocking a plan of joint action.
(Bancroft, <i>Seward</i>, II, p. 181.) I agree with C.F. Adams that
the only effect of this, so far as the negotiation is concerned was
that "Seward, by what has always, for some reason not at once
apparent, passed for a very astute proceeding, caused a transfer of
the whole negotiation from Washington to London and Paris."

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_318"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor318">[318]</a> A few facts about Southern privateering
not directly pertinent to this chapter are yet not without
interest. There was no case during the Civil War of a vessel
actually going out as a privateer (i.e., a private vessel operating
under government letters of marque) from a foreign port. (Adams,
"Seward and the Declaration of Paris," p. 38.) No Southern
privateer ever entered a British port. (Bernard, <i>Neutrality of
Great Britain</i>, p. 181). As a result of Seward's general
instruction of April 24, a convention was actually signed with
Russia in August, but it was not presented by Seward for
ratification to the United States Senate. Schleiden in a report to
the Senate of Bremen at the time of the <i>Trent</i> affair, Nov.
14, 1861, stated that the Russian Ambassador, von Stoeckl, inquired
of Seward "whether the U.S. would equip privateers in case war
should break out with England and France. Seward replied 'that is a
matter of course.' Mr. Stoeckl thereupon remarked that in any case
no American privateer would be permitted to cruise in the northern
part of the Pacific because Russia, which is the only state that
has ports in those regions, would treat them as pirates in
accordance with the Convention of August 24. Mr. Seward then
exclaimed: 'I never thought of that. I must write to Mr. Clay about
it.'" (Schleiden MS.)</blockquote>

<h3>BULL RUN; CONSUL BUNCH; COTTON AND MERCIER</h3>
<br>
<p>The diplomatic manoeuvres and interchanges recounted in the
preceding chapter were regarded by Foreign Secretaries and
Ministers as important in themselves and as indicative of national
policy and purpose. Upon all parties concerned they left a feeling
of irritation and suspicion. But the public knew nothing of the
details of the inconclusive negotiation and the Press merely gave a
hint now and then of its reported progress and ultimate failure.
Newspapers continued to report the news from America in
unaccustomed detail, but that news, after the attack on Fort
Sumter, was for some time lacking in striking incident, since both
sides in America were busily engaged in preparing for a struggle in
arms for which neither was immediately prepared. April 15, Lincoln
called for 75,000 volunteers, and three weeks later for 42,000
additional. The regular army was increased by 23,000 and the navy
by 18,000 men. Naval vessels widely scattered over the globe, were
instructed to hasten their home-coming. By July 1 Lincoln had an
available land force, however badly trained and organized, of over
300,000, though these were widely scattered from the Potomac in the
east to the Missouri in the west.</p>
<p>In the South, Davis was equally busy, calling at first for
100,000 volunteers to wage defensive battle in protection of the
newly-born Confederacy. The seven states already in secession were
soon joined, between May 4 and June 24, by four others, Arkansas,
Virginia, North Carolina and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_173"></a>[V1:pg 173]</span> Tennessee in order, but the
border states of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, though strongly
sympathetic with the rest of the South, were held to the Union by
the "border state policy" of Lincoln, the first pronouncement of
which asserted that the North had no purpose of attacking slavery
where it existed, but merely was determined to preserve the Union.
The Northern Congress, meeting in extra session on July 4, heartily
approved Lincoln's emergency measures. It authorized an army of
500,000, provided for a loan of $200,000,000, sanctioned the issue
of $50,000,000 in Treasury notes and levied new taxes, both direct
and by tariffs to meet these expenditures.</p>
<p>In the months preceding the attack on Sumter the fixed
determination of the South to secede and the uncertainty of the
North had led the British press to believe that the decision rested
wholly with the South. Now the North by its preparations was
exhibiting an equally fixed determination to preserve the Union,
and while the British press was sceptical of the permanence of this
determination, it became, for a short time, until editorial policy
was crystallized, more cautious in prophecy. The <i>Economist</i>
on May 4 declared that the responsibility for the "fatal step"
rested wholly on Southern leaders because of their passionate
desire to extend the shameful institution of which they were so
proud, but that the North must inevitably, by mere weight of
population and wealth, be the victor, though this could not
conceivably result in any real reunion, rather in a conquest
requiring permanent military occupation. Southern leaders were mad:
"to rouse by gratuitous insult the mettle of a nation three times
as numerous and far more than three times as powerful, to force
them by aggressive steps into a struggle in which the sympathy of
every free and civilized nation will be with the North, seems like
the madness of men whose eyes are blinded and hearts hardened by
the evil cause they defend."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"></a>[V1:pg 174]</span>
<p>Two weeks later, the <i>Economist</i>, while still maintaining
the justice of the Northern cause, though with lessened vigour,
appealed to the common sense of the North to refrain from a civil
war whose professed object was unattainable. "Everyone knows and
admits that the secession is an accomplished, irrevocable, fact....
Even if the North were sure of an easy and complete victory--short,
of course, of actual subjugation of the South (which no one dreams
of)--the war which was to end in such a victory would still be, in
the eyes of prudence and worldly wisdom, an objectless and
unprofitable folly<a name="FNanchor319"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_319">[319]</a>." But by the middle of June the American
irritation at the British Proclamation of Neutrality, loudly and
angrily voiced by the Northern press, had caused a British press
resentment at this "wilful misrepresentation and misjudgment" of
British attitude. "We <i>do</i> believe the secession of the Slave
States to be a <i>fait accompli</i>--a completed and irreversible
transaction. We believe it to be impossible now for the North to
lure back the South into the Union by any compromise, or to compel
them back by any force." "If this is an offence it cannot be
helped<a name="FNanchor320"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_320">[320]</a>."</p>
<p>The majority of the London papers, though not all, passed
through the same shifts of opinion and expression as the
<i>Economist</i>; first upbraiding the South, next appealing to the
North not to wage a useless war, finally committing themselves to
the theory of an accomplished break-up of the Union and berating
the North for continuing, through pride alone, a bloody conflict
doomed to failure. Meanwhile in midsummer attention was diverted
from the ethical causes at issue by the publication in the
<i>Times</i> of Motley's letter analysing the nature of the
American constitution and defending the legal position of the North
in its resistance to secession. Motley wrote in protest against the
general <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"></a>[V1:pg
175]</span> British press attitude: "There is, perhaps, a readiness
in England to prejudge the case; a disposition not to exult in our
downfall, but to accept the fact<a name="FNanchor321"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_321">[321]</a>...."</p>
<p>He argued the right and the duty of the North to force the South
into subjection. "The right of revolution is indisputable. It is
written on the record of our race. British and American history is
made up of rebellion and revolution.... There can be nothing
plainer, then, than the American right of revolution. But, then, it
should be called revolution." "It is strange that Englishmen should
find difficulty in understanding that the United States Government
is a nation among the nations of the earth; a constituted
authority, which may be overthrown by violence, as may be the fate
of any state, whether kingdom or republic, but which is false to
the people if it does not its best to preserve them from the
horrors of anarchy, even at the cost of blood."</p>
<p>Motley denied any <i>right</i> of <i>peaceful</i> secession, and
his constitutional argument presented adequately the Northern view.
But he was compelled also to refer to slavery and did so in the
sense of Lincoln's inaugural, asserting that the North had no
purpose of emancipating the slaves. "It was no question at all that
slavery within a state was sacred from all interference by the
general government, or by the free states, or by individuals in
those states; and the Chicago Convention [which nominated Lincoln]
strenuously asserted that doctrine." Coming at the moment when the
British press and public were seeking ground for a shift from
earlier pro-Northern expressions of sympathy to some justification
for the South, it may be doubted whether Motley's letter did not do
more harm than good to the Northern cause. His denial of a Northern
anti-slavery purpose gave excuse for a, professedly, more calm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"></a>[V1:pg 176]</span> and
judicial examination of the claimed <i>Southern right</i> of
secession, and his legal argument could be met, and was met, with
equally logical, apparently, pro-Southern argument as to the nature
of the American constitution. Thus early did the necessity of
Lincoln's "border state policy"--a policy which extended even to
warnings from Seward to American diplomats abroad not to bring into
consideration the future of slavery--give ground for foreign denial
that there were any great moral principles at stake in the American
conflict.</p>
<p>In the meantime the two sections in America were busily
preparing for a test of strength, and for that test the British
press, reporting preparations, waited with interest. It came on
July 21 in the first battle of Bull Run, when approximately equal
forces of raw levies, 30,000 each, met in the first pitched battle
of the war, and where the Northern army, after an initial success,
ultimately fled in disgraceful rout. Before Bull Run the few
British papers early taking strong ground for the North had
pictured Lincoln's preparations as so tremendous as inevitably
destined to crush, quickly, all Southern resistance. The <i>Daily
News</i> lauded Lincoln's message to Congress as the speech of a
great leader, and asserted that the issue in America was for all
free people a question of upholding the eternal principles of
liberty, morality and justice. "War for such a cause, though it be
civil war, may perhaps without impiety be called 'God's most
perfect instrument in working out a pure intent<a name=
"FNanchor322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322">[322]</a>.'" The disaster
to the Northern army, its apparent testimony that the North lacked
real fighting men, bolstered that British opinion which regarded
military measures against the South as folly--an impression
reinforced in the next few months by the long pause by the North
before undertaking any further great effort in the field. The North
was not really ready for determined war, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_177"></a>[V1:pg 177]</span> indeed, until
later in the year. Meanwhile many were the moralizations in the
British press upon Bull Run's revelation of Northern military
weakness.</p>
<p>Probably the most influential newspaper utterances of the moment
were the letters of W.H. Russell to the <i>Times</i>. This famous
war-correspondent had been sent to America in the spring of 1861 by
Delane, editor of the <i>Times</i>, his first letter, written on
March 29, appearing in the issue of April 16. He travelled through
the South, was met everywhere with eager courtesy as became a man
of his reputation and one representing the most important organ of
British public opinion, returned to the North in late June, and at
Washington was given intimate interviews by Seward and other
leaders. For a time his utterances were watched for, in both
England and America, with the greatest interest and expectancy, as
the opinions of an unusually able and thoroughly honest,
dispassionate observer. He never concealed his abhorrence of
slavery, terming apologists of that institution "the miserable
sophists who expose themselves to the contempt of the world by
their paltry theiscles on the divine origin and uses of
Slavery<a name="FNanchor323"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_323">[323]</a>...." and writing "day after day ... the
impression of my mind was strengthened that 'States Rights' meant
protection to slavery, extension of slave territory, and free-trade
in slave produce with the other world<a name=
"FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324">[324]</a>." But at the
same time he depicted the energy, ability, and determination of the
South in high colours, and was a bit doubtful of similar virtues in
the North. The battle of Bull Run itself he did not see, but he
rode out from Washington to meet the defeated army, and his
description of the routed rabble, jostling and pushing, in frenzy
toward the Capitol, so ridiculed Northern fighting spirit as to
leave a permanent <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_178"></a>[V1:pg 178]</span> sting behind it. At the same time
it convinced the British pro-Southern reader that the Northern
effort was doomed to failure, even though Russell was himself
guarded in opinion as to ultimate result. "'What will England and
France think of it?' is the question which is asked over and over
again," wrote Russell on July 24<a name="FNanchor325"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_325">[325]</a>, expatiating on American anxiety and
chagrin in the face of probable foreign opinion. On August 22 he
recorded in his diary the beginnings of the American newspaper
storm of personal attack because of his description of the battle
in the <i>Times</i>--an attack which before long became the alleged
cause of his recall by Delane<a name="FNanchor326"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_326">[326]</a>. In fact Russell's letters added nothing
in humiliating description to the outpourings of the Northern
press, itself greedily quoted by pro-Southern foreign papers. The
impression of Northern military incapacity was not confined to
Great Britain--it was general throughout Europe, and for the
remainder of 1861 there were few who ventured to assert a Northern
success in the war<a name="FNanchor327"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_327">[327]</a>.</p>
<p>Official Britain, however, saw no cause for any change in the
policy of strict neutrality. Palmerston commented privately, "The
truth is, the North are fighting for an Idea chiefly entertained by
professional politicians, while the South are fighting for what
they consider rightly or wrongly vital interests," thus explaining
to his own satisfaction why a Northern army of brave men had
<i>chosen</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179"></a>[V1:pg
179]</span> to <i>run</i> away<a name="FNanchor328"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_328">[328]</a>, but the Government was careful to
refrain from any official utterances likely to irritate the North.
The battle served, in some degree, to bring into the open the
metropolitan British papers which hitherto professing neutrality
and careful not to reveal too openly their leanings, now each took
a definite stand and became an advocate of a cause. The Duke of
Argyll might write reassuringly to Mrs. Motley to have no fear of
British interference<a name="FNanchor329"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_329">[329]</a>, and to Gladstone (evidently
controverting the latter's opinion) that slavery was and would
continue to be an object in the war<a name=
"FNanchor330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330">[330]</a>, but the press,
certainly, was not united either as to future British policy or on
basic causes and objects of the war. The <i>Economist</i> believed
that a second Southern victory like Bull Run, if coming soon, would
"so disgust and dishearten the shouters for the Union that the
contest will be abandoned on the instant.... Some day, with
scarcely any notice, we may receive tidings that an armistice has
been agreed upon and preliminaries of peace have been
signed<a name="FNanchor331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331">[331]</a>."
John Bright's paper, the <i>Morning Star</i>, argued long and
feverishly that Englishmen must not lose sight of the fact that
slavery was an issue, and made appeal for expressions, badly needed
at the moment, of pro-Northern sympathy<a name=
"FNanchor332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332">[332]</a>. To this
<i>John Bull</i> retorted:</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing can be clearer than this, that black slavery
has nothing whatever to do with this Civil War in America.... The
people of America have erected a political idol. The Northerners
have talked and written and boasted so much about their Republic
that they have now become perfectly furious to find that their idol
can be overthrown, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_180"></a>[V1:pg 180]</span> and that the false principles
upon which the American Republic is built should be exhibited to
the world, that their vaunted democracy should be exposed as a mere
bubble or a piece of rotten timber, an abominable and worthless
tyranny of the sovereign mob<a name="FNanchor333"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_333">[333]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Here was an early hint of the future of democracy as at
issue<a name="FNanchor334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334">[334]</a>.
<i>John Bull</i>, the "country squire's paper," might venture to
voice the thought, but more important papers were still cautious in
expressing it. W.H. Russell, privately, wrote to Delane: "It is
quite obvious, I think, that the North will succeed in reducing the
South<a name="FNanchor335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335">[335]</a>."
But Delane permitted no such positive prophecy to appear in the
<i>Times</i>. Darwin is good testimony of the all-prevalent British
feeling: "I hope to God we English are utterly wrong in doubting
whether the North can conquer the South." "How curious it is that
you seem to think that you can conquer the South; and I never meet
a soul, even those who would most wish it, who think it
possible--that is, to conquer and retain it<a name=
"FNanchor336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336">[336]</a>."</p>
<p>In September, after the first interest in Bull Run had waned,
there appeared several books and articles on the American question
which gave opportunity for renewal of newspaper comment and
controversy. A Dr. Lempriere, "of the Inner Temple, law fellow of
St. John's College, Oxford," published a work, <i>The American
Crisis Considered</i>, chiefly declamatory, upholding the right of
Southern secession, stating that no one "who has the slightest
acquaintance with the political action of history would term the
present movement rebellion." With this the <i>Spectator</i> begged
leave to differ<a name="FNanchor337"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_337">[337]</a>. The <i>Saturday Review</i> <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_181"></a>[V1:pg 181]</span> acknowledged
that a prolonged war might force slavery and emancipation to the
front, but denied them as vital at present, and offered this view
as a defence against the recrimination of Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, who had accused the paper of unfair treatment in a review of
her pamphlet exhibiting emancipation as the object of the North.
Under the caption, "Mrs. Beecher Stowe's Wounded Feelings," the
<i>Saturday Review</i> avowed disbelief in the existence of a "Holy
War" in America. "The North does not proclaim abolition and never
pretended to fight for anti-slavery. The North has not hoisted for
its oriflamme the Sacred Symbol of Justice to the Negro; its <i>cri
de guerre</i> is not unconditional emancipation." "The Governmental
course of the British nation ... is not yet directed by small
novelists and their small talk<a name="FNanchor338"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_338">[338]</a>." Thomas Hughes also came in for
sarcastic reference in this article, having promptly taken up the
cudgels for Mrs. Stowe. He returned to the attack through the
columns of the <i>Spectator</i>, reasserting slavery as an issue
and calling on Englishmen to put themselves in the place of
Americans and realize the anger aroused by "deliberate imputations
of mean motives," and by the cruel spirit of the utterances. A
nation engaged in a life and death struggle should not be treated
in a tone of flippant and contemptuous serenity. The British press
had chosen "to impute the lowest motives, to cull out and exult
over all the meanness, and bragging, and disorder which the contest
has brought out, and while we sit on the bank, to make no
allowances for those who are struggling in the waves<a name=
"FNanchor339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339">[339]</a>."</p>
<p>Besides the <i>Spectator</i>, on the Northern side, stood the
<i>Daily News</i>, declaring that the South could not hold out, and
adding, "The Confederate States may be ten millions, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_182"></a>[V1:pg 182]</span> but they
<i>are</i> wrong--notoriously, flagrantly wrong<a name=
"FNanchor340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340">[340]</a>." The <i>Daily
News</i>, according to its "Jubilee" historians, stood almost alone
in steadfast advocacy of the Northern cause<a name=
"FNanchor341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341">[341]</a>. This claim of
unique service to the North is not borne out by an examination of
newspaper files, but is true if only metropolitan dailies of large
circulation are considered. The <i>Spectator</i> was a determined
and consistent friend of the North. In its issue of September 28 a
speech made by Bulwer Lytton was summarized and attacked. The
speaker had argued that the dissolution of the Union would be
beneficial to all Europe, which had begun to fear the swollen size
and strength of the young nation across the Atlantic. He hoped that
the final outcome would be not two, but at least four separate
nations, and stated his belief that the friendly emulation of these
nations would result for Americans in a rapid advance in art and
commerce such as had been produced in the old commonwealths of
Greece. The <i>Spectator</i> answered that such a breaking up of
America was much more likely to result in a situation comparable to
that in South America, inquired caustically whether Bulwer Lytton
had heard that slavery was in question, and asserted that his
speech presumably represented the official view of the Tories, and
embodied that of the English governing class<a name=
"FNanchor342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342">[342]</a>.</p>
<p>In press utterances during the autumn and early fall of 1861
there is little on British policy toward America. Strict neutrality
is approved by all papers and public speakers. But as the months
passed without further important military engagements attention
began to be directed toward the economic effects on England of the
war <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183"></a>[V1:pg 183]</span>
in America and to the blockade, now beginning to be made effective
by the North. The <i>Saturday Review</i>, though pro-Southern,
declared for neutrality, but distinguished between strict
observance of the blockade and a reasonable recognition of the
<i>de facto</i> government of the Confederacy "as soon as the
Southern States had achieved for their independence that amount of
security with which Great Britain had been satisfied in former
cases<a name="FNanchor343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343">[343]</a>."
But another article in the same issue contained a warning against
forcibly raising the blockade since this must lead to war with the
North, and that would commend itself to no thoughtful Englishman.
Two weeks later appeared a long review of Spence's <i>American
Union</i>, a work very influential in confirming British
pro-Southern belief in the constitutional right of the South to
secede and in the certainty of Southern victory. Spence was "likely
to succeed with English readers, because all his views are taken
from a thoroughly English standpoint<a name=
"FNanchor344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344">[344]</a>." The week
following compliments are showered upon the "young professor"
Montague Bernard for his "Two Lectures on the Present American
War," in which he distinguished between recognition of belligerency
and recognition of sovereignty, asserting that the former was
inevitable and logical. The <i>Saturday Review</i>, without direct
quotation, treated Bernard as an advocate also of the early
recognition of Southern independence on the ground that it was <i>a
fait accompli</i>, and expressed approval<a name=
"FNanchor345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345">[345]</a>.</p>
<p>These few citations, taken with intent from the more sober and
reputable journals, summarize the prevailing attitude on one side
or the other throughout the months from June to December, 1861. All
publications had much <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_184"></a>[V1:pg 184]</span> to say of the American struggle
and varied in tone from dignified criticism to extreme
vituperation, this last usually being the resort of lesser
journals, whose leader writers had no skill in "vigorous" writing
in a seemingly restrained manner. "Vigorous" leader writing was a
characteristic of the British press of the day, and when combined
with a supercilious British tone of advice, as from a superior
nation, gave great offence to Americans, whether North or South.
But the British press was yet united in proclaiming as correct the
governmental policy of neutrality, and in any event Motley was
right in stating "the Press is not the Government," adding his
opinion that "the present English Government has thus far given us
no just cause of offence<a name="FNanchor346"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_346">[346]</a>." Meanwhile the Government, just at the
moment when the Declaration of Paris negotiation had reached an
inglorious conclusion, especially irritating to Earl Russell, was
suddenly plunged into a sharp controversy with the United States by
an incident growing out of Russell's first instructions to Lyons in
regard to that negotiation and which, though of minor importance in
itself, aroused an intensity of feeling beyond its merits. This was
the recall by Seward of the exequatur of the British consul Bunch,
at Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in his first instruction to Lyons on
the Declaration of Paris Russell had directed that Bunch, at
Charleston, be commissioned to seek a Southern official acceptance
of the binding force of the second and third articles, but that
Lyons and Mercier, fearing Seward's irritation, had hesitated to
proceed in the matter. Later Russell had recalled his instructions,
but before this recall could reach Lyons the latter had decided to
act<a name="FNanchor347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347">[347]</a>. On
July 5 Lyons gave explicit directions to Bunch not to approach the
Confederate Government directly, but to go <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_185"></a>[V1:pg 185]</span> to Governor
Pickens of South Carolina and explain the matter to him verbally,
adding "you should act with great caution, in order to avoid
raising the question of the recognition of the new Confederation by
Great Britain." Unfortunately Lyons also wrote, "I am authorized by
Lord John Russell to confide the negotiation on this matter to
you," thus after all implying that a real <i>negotiation</i> with
the South was being undertaken. On the same day Mercier sent
similar instructions to St. Andr&eacute;, the French Acting-Consul
at Charleston<a name="FNanchor348"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_348">[348]</a>. Bunch received Lyons' official letter on
July 19<a name="FNanchor349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349">[349]</a>,
together with a private one of July 5, emphasizing that Bunch was
to put nothing in writing, and that he and his French colleagues
were to keep the names of Lyons and Mercier out of any talk, even,
about the matter. Bunch was to talk as if his instructions came
directly from Russell. Lyons hoped the South would be wise enough
not to indulge in undue publicity, since if "trumpeted" it might
elicit "by such conduct some strong disavowal from France and
England." Both the official and the private letter must, however,
have impressed Bunch with the idea that this was after all a
negotiation and that he had been entrusted with it<a name=
"FNanchor350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350">[350]</a>.</p>
<p>Bunch, whose early reports had been far from sympathetic with
the Southern cause, had gradually, and quite naturally from his
environment, become more friendly to it<a name=
"FNanchor351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351">[351]</a>. He now acted
with promptness and with some <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_186"></a>[V1:pg 186]</span> evident exultation at the
importance given him personally. In place of Governor Pickens an
experienced diplomat, William Henry Trescott, was approached by
Bunch and Belligny, who, not St. Andr&eacute;, was then the French
agent at Charleston<a name="FNanchor352"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_352">[352]</a>. Trescott went directly to President
Davis, who at once asked why the British proposal had not been made
through the Confederate Commissioners in London, and who somewhat
unwillingly yielded to Trescott's urging. On August 13 the
Confederate Congress resolved approval of the Declaration of Paris
except for the article on privateering<a name=
"FNanchor353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353">[353]</a>. Bunch took
great pride in the secrecy observed. "I do not see how any clue is
given to the way in which the Resolutions have been procured.... We
made a positive stipulation that France and England were not to be
alluded to in the event of the compliance of the Confederate
Govt.<a name="FNanchor354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354">[354]</a>,"
he wrote Lyons on August 16. But he failed to take account either
of the penetrating power of mouth-to-mouth gossip or of the
efficacy of Seward's secret agents. On this same day, August 16,
Lyons reported the arrest in New York, on the fourteenth, of one
Robert Mure, just as he was about to take passage for Liverpool
carrying a sealed bag from the Charleston consulate to the British
Foreign Office, as well as some two hundred private letters. The
letters were examined and among them was one which related Bunch's
recent activities and stated that "Mr. B., on oath of secrecy,
communicated to me also that the first step of recognition was
taken<a name="FNanchor355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355">[355]</a>."
The sealed bag was sent unopened to be handed by Adams to Russell
with an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187"></a>[V1:pg
187]</span> enquiry whether in fact it contained any papers on the
alleged "negotiation" with the South.</p>
<p>Bunch had issued to Mure a paper which the latter regarded as a
passport, as did the United States. This also was made matter of
complaint by Adams, when on September 3 the affair was presented to
Russell. America complained of Bunch on several counts, the three
principal ones being (1) that he had apparently conducted a
negotiation with the Confederacy, (2) that he had issued a
passport, not countersigned by the Secretary of State as required
by the United States rules respecting foreign consuls, (3) that he
had permitted the person to whom this passport was issued to carry
letters from the enemies of the United States to their agents
abroad. On these grounds the British Government was requested to
remove Bunch from his office. On first learning of Mure's arrest
Lyons expressed the firm belief that Bunch's conduct had been
perfectly proper and that the sealed bag would be found to contain
nothing supporting the suspicion of the American Government<a name=
"FNanchor356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356">[356]</a>. The language
used by Lyons was such as to provide an excellent defence in
published despatches, and it was later so used. But privately
neither Lyons nor Russell were wholly convinced of the correctness
of Bunch's actions. Bunch had heard of Mure's arrest on August 18,
and at once protested that no passport had been given, but merely a
"Certificate to the effect that he [Mure] was a British Merchant
residing in Charleston" on his way to England, and that he was
carrying official despatches to the Foreign Office<a name=
"FNanchor357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357">[357]</a>. In fact Mure
had long since taken out American citizenship papers, and the
distinction between passport and certificate seems an evasion.
Officially Lyons could report "it is clear that Mr. Robert Mure, in
taking charge <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"></a>[V1:pg
188]</span> of the letters which have been seized, abused Mr.
Bunch's confidence, for Mr. Bunch had positive instructions from me
not to forward himself any letters alluding to military or
political events, excepting letters to or from British
officials<a name="FNanchor358"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_358">[358]</a>." This made good reading when put in the
published Parliamentary Papers. But in reality the sending of
private letters by messenger also carrying an official pouch was no
novelty. Bunch had explained to Lyons on June 23 that this was his
practice on the ground that "there is really no way left for the
merchants but through me. If Mr. Seward objects I cannot help it. I
must leave it to your Lordship and H.M.'s Government to support me.
My own despatch to Lord J. Russell I must send in some way, and so
I take the responsibility of aiding British interests by sending
the mercantile letters as well<a name="FNanchor359"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_359">[359]</a>." And in Bunch's printed report to Lyons
on Mure's arrest, his reply as to the private letters was, "I could
not consider him [Mure] as being disqualified from being the bearer
of a bag to Earl Russell, by his doing what everyone who left
Charleston was doing daily<a name="FNanchor360"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_360">[360]</a>...."</p>
<p>Officially Lyons, on September 2, had reported a conversation
with Belligny, the French Consul at Charleston, now in Washington,
writing, "I am confirmed in the opinion that the negotiation, which
was difficult and delicate, was managed with great tact and good
judgment by the two Consuls<a name="FNanchor361"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_361">[361]</a>." But this referred merely to the use of
Trescott and its results, not to Bunch's use of Mure. The British
Government was, indeed, prepared to defend the action of its agents
in securing, <i>indirectly</i>, from the South, an <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_189"></a>[V1:pg 189]</span> acknowledgment
of certain principles of international law. Russell did not believe
that Lincoln was "foolhardy enough to quarrel with England and
France," though Hammond (Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs) "is
persuaded that Seward wishes to pick a quarrel<a name=
"FNanchor362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362">[362]</a>." Enquiry was
promptly made of France, through Cowley, as to her stand in the
matter of the consuls at Charleston, Russell intimating by an
enquiry (later printed in the Parliamentary Papers), as to the
initiation of the Declaration of Paris negotiations, that it was
Thouvenel who had first suggested the approach to the South through
the Consuls<a name="FNanchor363"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_363">[363]</a>. This was an error of memory<a name=
"FNanchor364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364">[364]</a>, and Cowley was
perturbed by Thouvenel's reticence in reply to the main question.
The latter stated that if a like American demand were made on
France "undoubtedly he could not give up an Agent who had done no
more than execute the orders entrusted to him<a name=
"FNanchor365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365">[365]</a>." This looked
like harmony, but the situation for the two countries was not the
same as no demand had been made for the recall of Belligny. Cowley
was, in reality, anxious and suspicious, for Thouvenel, in
conversation, attributed Seward's anger to Bunch's alleged
indiscretions in talk, and made it clear that France would not
"stand by" unless Seward should protest to France against the fact
of a communication (not a <i>negotiation</i>) having been held with
the Confederacy<a name="FNanchor366"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_366">[366]</a>. Before the French reply was secured
Russell had prepared but not sent an answer to Adams, notifying him
that the bag from Bunch, on examination, was found not to contain
"correspondence of the enemies <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_190"></a>[V1:pg 190]</span> of the Government of the United
States" as had been suspected, and transmitting a copy of Bunch's
explanation of the reason for forwarding private letters<a name=
"FNanchor367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367">[367]</a>. In another
letter to Adams of the same date Russell avowed the Government's
responsibility for Bunch's action on the Declaration of Paris, and
declined to recall him, adding:</p>
<blockquote>"But when it is stated in a letter from some person not
named, that the first step to the recognition of the Southern
States by Great Britain has been taken, the Undersigned begs to
decline all responsibility for such a statement.<br>
<br>
"Her Majesty's Government have already recognized the belligerent
character of the Southern States, and they will continue to
recognize them as belligerents. But Her Majesty's Government have
not recognized and are not prepared to recognize the so-called
Confederate States as a separate and independent State<a name=
"FNanchor368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368">[368]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Adams received Russell's two notes on September 13<a name=
"FNanchor369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369">[369]</a>, and merely
stated that they would be despatched by the next steamer. That
Russell was anxious is shown by a careful letter of caution to
Lyons instructing him if sent away from Washington "to express in
the most dignified and guarded terms that the course taken by the
Washington Government must be the result of a misconception on
their part, and that you shall retire to Canada in the persuasion
that the misunderstanding will soon cease, and the former friendly
relations be restored<a name="FNanchor370"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_370">[370]</a>." Meantime Russell was far from satisfied
with Bunch, writing Lyons to inform him that the "statements made
in regard to his proceedings <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_191"></a>[V1:pg 191]</span> require explanation<a name=
"FNanchor371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371">[371]</a>." The failure
of Seward to demand Belligny's recall worried Russell. He wrote to
Palmerston on September 19, "I cannot believe that the Americans,
having made no demand on the French to disavow Belligny, or
Baligny, will send away Lyons," and he thought that Seward ought to
be satisfied as England had disavowed the offensive part of Bunch's
supposed utterances. He was not in favour of sending reinforcements
to the American stations: "If they do not quarrel about Bunch, we
may rest on our oars for the winter<a name=
"FNanchor372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372">[372]</a>." There was
nothing further to do save to wait Seward's action on receipt of
the British refusal to recall Bunch. At this moment Lyons at
Washington was writing in a hopeful view of "avoiding abstract
assertions of principles," but accustoming the North to the
<i>practice</i> of British recognition of Southern belligerent
rights<a name="FNanchor373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373">[373]</a>.
Lyons believed that Seward would not go further than to withdraw
Bunch's exequatur, but he was anxious for the return of Mercier
(long absent with Prince Napoleon), since "our position is
unluckily not exactly the same with that of France<a name=
"FNanchor374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374">[374]</a>." On October 12
Lyons conferred at length with Seward on the Bunch matter, as
usual, privately and unofficially. Seward dwelt on a letter just
received from Motley assuring him that Great Britain was not
"unfriendly to the United States," and "appeared anxious not to
pick a quarrel, yet hardly knowing how to retract from his original
position." Lyons told <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_192"></a>[V1:pg 192]</span> Seward that it would be
"impossible to carry on the Diplomatic business ... on the false
hypothesis that the United States Government" did not <i>know</i>
England and France had recognized the belligerent rights of the
South, and he urged Russell to get from France an open
acknowledgment, such as England has made, that she "negotiated"
with the Confederacy. Lyons thought Mercier would try to avoid
this, thus seeking to bring pressure on the British Government to
adopt his plan of an early recognition of Southern independence.
Like Cowley, Lyons was disturbed at the French evasion of direct
support in the Bunch affair<a name="FNanchor375"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_375">[375]</a>.</p>
<p>Bunch's formal denial to Lyons of the charges made against him
by the United States was confined to three points; he asserted his
disbelief that Mure carried any despatches from the <i>de facto</i>
government at Richmond; he protested that "there was not one single
paper in my bag which was not entirely and altogether on Her
Majesty's service"; and he explained the alleged "passport" was not
intended as such, but was merely "a certificate stating that Mr.
Mure was charged by me with despatches," but he acknowledged that
in the certificate's description of Mure as a "British merchant" a
possible error had been committed, adding, however, that he had
supposed anyone would understand, since the words "British subject"
had not been used, that Mure was in reality a naturalized citizen
of America<a name="FNanchor376"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_376">[376]</a>. This explanation was received by Russell
on October 21. Lyons' comment on Bunch's explanation, made without
knowledge of what would be Seward's final determination, was that
if Bunch had any further excuses to make about the private letters
carried by Mure he should drop two weak points in his argument. "I
mean the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"></a>[V1:pg
193]</span> distinction between B. merchant and B.S., and the
distinction between a document requesting that the bearer '<i>may
be permitted to pass freely and receive all proper protection and
assistance</i>' and a passport<a name="FNanchor377"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_377">[377]</a>." Russell, on receipt of Bunch's
explanation was also dissatisfied, first because Bunch had violated
Lyons' instructions against entrusting despatches to persons
carrying private correspondence, and second, because Bunch "gives
no distinct denial" to the newspaper stories that he had gossiped
about his activities and had stated them to be "a first step toward
recognition<a name="FNanchor378"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_378">[378]</a>." These criticisms were directed entirely
to Bunch's conduct subsequent to the overture to the South; on the
propriety of that act Russell supported Bunch with vigour<a name=
"FNanchor379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379">[379]</a>. October 26,
Seward read to Lyons the instruction to Adams on the revocation of
Bunch's exequatur. The ground taken for this, reported Lyons, was
an evasion of that charge of communicating with the South for which
Russell had avowed responsibility, and a turning to the charge that
Bunch was personally unacceptable longer to the United States
because of his partisanship to the South, as evidenced by various
acts and especially as shown by his reported assertion that Great
Britain had taken "a first step to recognition." "Never," wrote
Lyons, "were serious charges brought upon a slighter foundation."
"No one who has read Mr. Bunch's despatches to your Lordship and to
me can consider him as in the least degree a partisan of the
Southern cause." "When Mr. Seward had finished reading the despatch
I remained silent. After a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_194"></a>[V1:pg 194]</span> short pause I took leave of him
courteously, and withdrew<a name="FNanchor380"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_380">[380]</a>."</p>
<p>As will have been noted, Lyons had foreseen the American
decision against Bunch on purely personal grounds, had been
relieved that this would be the issue, and had fore-warned Russell.
His despatch just cited may be regarded as a suggestion of the
proper British refutation of charges, but with acceptance of the
American decision. Nevertheless he wrote gloomily on the same day
of future relations with the United States<a name=
"FNanchor381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381">[381]</a>. At the same
time Russell, also foreseeing Seward's action, was not disturbed.
He thought it still "not off the cards that the Southern
Confederates may return to the Union.... Our conduct must be
strictly neutral, and it will be<a name="FNanchor382"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_382">[382]</a>." Upon receipt of Lyons' despatch and
letter of October 28 Russell wrote to Palmerston, "I do not attach
much importance to this letter of Lyons. It is the business of
Seward to feed the mob with sacrifices every day, and we happen to
be the most grateful food he can offer<a name=
"FNanchor383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383">[383]</a>." For Russell
saw clearly that Great Britain could not object to the removal of
Bunch on the purely personal grounds alleged by Seward. There
followed in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195"></a>[V1:pg
195]</span> due course the formal notification by Adams on November
21, just six days before he learned of the <i>Trent</i> affair,
which had occurred on November 8. That alarming incident no doubt
coloured the later communications of both parties, for while both
Adams and Russell indulged in several lengthy argumentative papers,
such as are dear to the hearts of lawyers and diplomats, the only
point of possible further dispute was on the claim of Great Britain
that future occasions might arise where, in defence of British
interests, it would be absolutely necessary to communicate with the
Confederacy. Adams acknowledged a British duty to protect its
citizens, but reasserted the American right to dismiss any British
agent who should act as Bunch had done. On December 9, Russell
closed the matter by stating that he did "not perceive that any
advantage would be obtained by the continuance of this
correspondence<a name="FNanchor384"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_384">[384]</a>." Bunch was expected to leave Charleston
as soon as a safe conveyance could be provided for him, but this
was not immediately forthcoming. In fact he remained at Charleston
until February, 1863, actively engaged, but official papers were
signed by his vice-consul. In the excitement over the <i>Trent</i>,
he seems rapidly to have disappeared from the official as he did
from the public horizon<a name="FNanchor385"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_385">[385]</a>.</p>
<p>The Bunch controversy, seemingly of no great importance in so
far as the alleged personal grounds of complaint are concerned, had
its real significance in the effort of Great <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_196"></a>[V1:pg 196]</span> Britain to make
contact with the Southern Government--an effort incautiously
entered upon, and from which an attempt to withdraw had come too
late. The result was British assertion of a right in case of
necessity to make such contact, having recognized the South as a
belligerent, but a discontinuance of the practice, under the
American protest<a name="FNanchor386"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_386">[386]</a>. While this controversy was in progress
the attention of the British Government was directed to a proposal
urged by Mercier upon Lyons in Washington, which appeared to have
the support of the French Government. On September 30, Mercier, so
Lyons reported, had received a private letter from Thouvenel
expressing great concern over the prospective scarcity of cotton
from America, due to the blockade, and asking Mercier's advice. The
latter now informed Lyons that his reply had outlined the following
steps: first, complete harmony of action between England and
France; second, recognition of Southern independence; third,
refusal longer to recognize the blockade; fourth, England and
France to be alert to seize the "favourable moment," when the North
became disheartened, the present moment not being a good
one<a name="FNanchor387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387">[387]</a>.
This policy Mercier thought so "bold" that the North would be
deterred from declaring war. The two diplomats held long argument
over this suggestion. Lyons acknowledged the general pressure for
cotton, but thought there was no need of great alarm as yet and
also advanced the idea that in the end Europe would benefit by
being forced to develop other sources of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_197"></a>[V1:pg 197]</span> supply, thus
being freed from such exclusive dependence on the United States.
Mercier answered that France was in dire need and could not wait
and he urged that mere recognition of the South would not secure
cotton--it was necessary also to break the blockade. In comment to
Russell, Lyons agreed that this was true, but thought the fact in
itself an argument against accepting Mercier's ideas: "The time is
far distant when the intervention of England and France in the
quarrel would be welcomed, or, unless under compulsion, tolerated
by the American peoples." The South had not yet "gone far enough in
establishing its independence to render a recognition of it either
proper or desirable for European powers," and he stated with
emphasis that recognition would <i>not</i> end the war unless there
was also an <i>alliance</i> with the South<a name=
"FNanchor388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388">[388]</a>.</p>
<p>In the British Cabinet also, at this same time, attention was
being directed to the question of cotton, not, primarily, by any
push from the British manufacturing interest, but because of
queries addressed to it by the French Minister in London. Russell
wrote to Palmerston, referring to the inquiry of Flahault, "I agree
with you that the cotton question may become serious at the end of
the year," but he added that Lindsay had informed him that in any
case cotton could not be brought in the winter-time from the
interior to the Southern ports<a name="FNanchor389"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_389">[389]</a>. In truth any serious thought given at
this time to the question of cotton appears to be the result of the
French arguments at London and Washington advocating a vigorous
American policy. October 19, Lyons and Mercier renewed debate on
exactly the same lines as previously, Mercier this time reading to
Lyons an instruction from Thouvenel and his reply. Lyons insisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"></a>[V1:pg 198]</span>
that the North would most certainly declare war on any power that
recognized the South and asserted that such a war would cause more
suffering many times than all the suffering now caused by the
shortage of cotton. Yet Lyons felt compelled to use caution and
conciliation in dealing with Mercier, because of the desire to
preserve close harmony of attitude<a name=
"FNanchor390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390">[390]</a>. A few clays
later Lyons' comments seemed wholly justified when Mercier reported
to him the tone of a conversation with Seward, after having left
with him a copy of Thouvenel's instruction. Seward said plainly
that the United States would go to war with any foreign power that
tried to interfere and that the only way in which France could get
cotton was by a Northern conquest of the South. He acknowledged
that the United States might be defeated, but he informed Mercier
that France would at least know there had been a war. On his part
Mercier told Seward that in his opinion there was but one possible
outcome in America--separation--and that he had advised Thouvenel
that the true policy of England and France was to recognize the
South and "bring about a peaceful separation." Lyons' comment to
Russell is that Seward had certainly taken a "high" tone--evident
justification of Lyons' previously expressed opinion. Seward had
been very eager to learn whether England knew of Thouvenel's
instruction, to which Mercier replied "no," and was now anxious
that Russell should not reveal to Adams that Lyons had known the
contents before delivery to Seward--a caution with which Lyons was
very content<a name="FNanchor391"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_391">[391]</a>.</p>
<p>Lyons' first report of Mercier's ideas had been received in
London at a rather critical moment. On October 17, just after
Adams' complaint about Bunch and Russell's answer, while waiting to
see whether Seward would magnify <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_199"></a>[V1:pg 199]</span> that incident into a cause of
rupture, and four days before Bunch's "unsatisfactory explanation"
had been received, Russell wrote to Palmerston:</p>
<blockquote>"There is much good sense in Mercier's
observations.<br>
But we must wait. I am persuaded that if we do anything,<br>
it must be on a grand scale. It will not do for England<br>
and France to break a blockade for the sake of getting<br>
cotton. But, in Europe, powers have often said to belligerents,<br>
Make up your quarrels. We propose to give terms<br>
of pacification which we think fair and equitable. If you<br>
accept them, well and good. But, if your adversary accepts<br>
them and you refuse them, our mediation is at an end,<br>
and you may expect to see us your enemies. France would<br>
be quite ready to hold this language with us.<br>
<br>
"If such a policy were to be adopted the time for it<br>
would be the end of the year, or immediately before the<br>
meeting of Parliament<a name="FNanchor392"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_392">[392]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Russell under the irritations of the moment was
somewhat carried away by Mercier's suggestion. That it was but a
briefly held thought has been shown by expressions from him already
cited<a name="FNanchor393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393">[393]</a>.
Nor was he alone in ministerial uncertainty<a name=
"FNanchor394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394">[394]</a>, but Palmerston
was not inclined to alter British policy. October 18, he replied to
Russell:</p>
<blockquote>"As to North America, our best and true policy seems
to<br>
be to go on as we have begun, and to keep quite clear of the<br>
conflict between North and South.... The only<br>
excuse [for intervention] would be the danger to the
intervening<br>
parties if the conflict went on; but in the American<br>
case this can not be pleaded by the Powers of Europe.<br>
<br>
"I quite agree with you that the want of cotton would<br>
not justify such a proceeding, unless, indeed, the distress<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200"></a>[V1:pg 200]</span>
created by that want was far more serious than it is likely<br>
to be. The probability is that some cotton will find its way<br>
to us from America, and that we shall get a greater supply<br>
than usual from other quarters.<br>
<br>
"The only thing to do seems to be to lie on our oars<br>
and to give no pretext to the Washingtonians to quarrel<br>
with us, while, on the other hand, we maintain our rights<br>
and those of our fellow countrymen<a name=
"FNanchor395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395">[395]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In Washington the result of Mercier's conversation with Seward,
outlining Thouvenel's suggestions, was a long and carefully
prepared despatch to Dayton, in Paris, which the biographer of
Seward thinks was one of his "great despatches; perhaps it was his
greatest, if we consider his perfect balance and the diplomatic way
in which he seemed to ignore what was menacing, while he adroitly
let Thouvenel see what the result would be if the implied threats
should be carried out<a name="FNanchor396"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_396">[396]</a>." Seward argued with skill the entire
matter of cotton, but he was none the less firm in diplomatic
defiance of foreign intervention. Since Great Britain had taken no
part in the French scheme--a point which Seward was careful to make
clear to Dayton--the despatch needs no expanded treatment here. Its
significance is that when reported to Lyons by Mercier (for Seward
had read it to the latter) the British Minister could pride himself
on having already pointed out to both Mercier and Russell that
Seward's line was exactly that which he had prophesied. Mercier
again was very anxious that his confidences to Lyons should not
become known, and Lyons was glad indeed to be wholly free from any
share in the discussion<a name="FNanchor397"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_397">[397]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201"></a>[V1:pg 201]</span>
<p>Two days after thus describing events, Lyons, on November 6, had
still another communication, and apparently a last on this topic,
with Mercier, in which the two men again went over the whole ground
of national policy toward America, and in which their divergent
views became very apparent. The arguments were the same, but
expressed with more vigour. Mercier seems, indeed, to have
attempted to "rush" Lyons into acquiescence in his policy. Lyons
finally observed to him that he "had no reason to suppose that Her
Majesty's Government considered the time was come for entertaining
at all the question of recognizing the South" and asked what good
such a step would do anyway. Mercier replied that he did not
believe that the North would declare war, and so it would be a step
toward settlement. To this Lyons took positive exception<a name=
"FNanchor398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398">[398]</a>. Lyons' report
of this conversation was written on November 8, a date which was
soon to stand out as that on which occurred an event more
immediately threatening to British-American relations than any
other during the Civil War.</p>
<p>The battle of Bull Run had left on British minds an impression
of Northern incapacity in war--even a doubt of Northern courage and
determination. On August 19 the Declaration of Paris negotiation, a
favourable result from which was eagerly desired by Russell, had
failed, as he well knew when he attached to the convention that
explanatory statement limiting its action in point of time. In the
end Russell felt that Britain had just escaped a "trap." Two weeks
after this Russell learned of the arrest of Mure, and soon of the
demand for Bunch's recall, finally and formally made by Adams on
November 21. Just six days later, on November 27, London heard of
the <i>Trent</i> affair of November 8. It is small wonder that
Russell <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202"></a>[V1:pg
202]</span> and his colleagues felt an increasing uncertainty as to
the intent of the United States, and also an increasing irritation
at having to guard their steps with such care in a situation where
they sincerely believed the only possible outcome was the
dissolution of the American Union. But up to the moment when the
news of the <i>Trent</i> affair was received they had pursued a
policy, so they believed, of strict and upright neutrality, and
were fixed in the determination not to permit minor controversies
or economic advantage to divert them from it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE "TRENT"</h3>
<br>
<p>The <i>Trent</i> affair seemed to Great Britain like the climax
of American arrogance<a name="FNanchor399"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_399">[399]</a>. The Confederate agents sent to Europe at
the outbreak of the Civil War had accomplished little, and after
seven months of waiting for a more favourable turn in foreign
relations, President Davis determined to replace them by two
"Special Commissioners of the Confederate States of America." These
were James M. Mason of Virginia, for Great Britain, and John
Slidell of Louisiana, for France. Their appointment indicated that
the South had at last awakened to the need of a serious foreign
policy. It was publicly and widely commented on by the Southern
press, thereby arousing an excited apprehension in the North,
almost as if the mere sending of two new men with instructions to
secure recognition abroad were tantamount to the actual
accomplishment of their object.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"></a>[V1:pg 204]</span>
<p>Mason and Slidell succeeded in running the blockade at
Charleston on the night of October 12, 1861, on the Confederate
steamer <i>Theodora</i><a name="FNanchor400"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_400">[400]</a>, and arrived at New Providence, Nassau,
on the fourteenth, thence proceeded by the same vessel to Cardenas,
Cuba, and from that point journeyed overland to Havana, arriving
October 22. In the party there were, besides the two envoys, their
secretaries, McFarland and Eustis, and the family of Slidell. On
November 7 they sailed for the Danish island of St. Thomas,
expecting thence to take a British steamer for Southampton. The
vessel on which they left Havana was the British contract
mail-packet <i>Trent</i>, whose captain had full knowledge of the
diplomatic character of his passengers. About noon on November 8
the <i>Trent</i> was stopped in the Bahama Channel by the United
States sloop of war, <i>San Jacinto</i>, Captain Wilkes commanding,
by a shot across the bows, and a boarding party took from the
<i>Trent</i> Mason and Slidell with their secretaries, transferred
them to the <i>San Jacinto</i>, and proceeded to an American port.
Protest was made both by the captain of the <i>Trent</i> and by
Commander Williams, R.N., admiralty agent in charge of mails on
board the ship<a name="FNanchor401"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_401">[401]</a>. The two envoys also declared that they
would yield only to personal compulsion, whereupon hands were laid
upon shoulders and coat collars, and, accepting this as the
application of <i>force</i>, they were transferred to the <i>San
Jacinto's</i> boats. The scene on the <i>Trent</i>, as described by
all parties, both then and later, partakes of the nature of comic
opera, yet was serious enough to the participants. In fact, the
envoys, especially Slidell, were exultant in the conviction that
the action of Wilkes would inevitably result in the early
realization of the object of their <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_205"></a>[V1:pg 205]</span> journey--recognition of the
South, at least by Great Britain<a name="FNanchor402"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_402">[402]</a>. Once on board the <i>San Jacinto</i>
they were treated more like guests on a private yacht, having
"seats at the captain's table," than as enemy prisoners on an
American war-ship.</p>
<p>Captain Wilkes had acted without orders, and, indeed, even
without any recent official information from Washington. He was
returning from a cruise off the African coast, and had reached St.
Thomas on October 10. A few days later, when off the south coat of
Cuba, he had learned of the Confederate appointment of Mason and
Slidell, and on the twenty-eighth, in Havana harbour, he heard that
the Commissioners were to sail on the <i>Trent</i>. At once he
conceived the idea of intercepting the <i>Trent</i>, exercising the
right of search, and seizing the envoys, in spite of the alleged
objections of his executive officer, Lieutenant Fairfax. The result
was that quite without authority from the United States Navy
Department, and solely upon his own responsibility, a challenge was
addressed to Britain, the "mistress of the seas," certain to be
accepted by that nation as an insult to national prestige and
national pride not quietly to be suffered.</p>
<p>The <i>San Jacinto</i> reached Fortress Monroe on the evening of
November 15. The next day the news was known, but since it was
Saturday, few papers contained more than brief and inaccurate
accounts and, there being then few Sunday papers, it was not until
Monday, the eighteenth, that there broke out a widespread rejoicing
and glorification in the Northern press<a name=
"FNanchor403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403">[403]</a>. America, for a
few days, passed through a spasm of exultation hard to understand,
even by those who felt it, once the first emotion had subsided.
This had various causes, but among them is evident a quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"></a>[V1:pg 206]</span>
childish fear of the acuteness and abilities of Mason and Slidell.
Both men were indeed persons of distinction in the politics of the
previous decades. Mason had always been open in his expressed
antipathy to the North, especially to New England, had long been a
leader in Virginia, and at the time of the Southern secession, was
a United States Senator from that State. Slidell, a Northerner by
birth, but early removed to Louisiana, had acquired fortune in
business there, and had for nearly twenty years been the political
"boss" of one faction of the Democratic Party in New Orleans and in
the State. With much previous experience in diplomacy, especially
that requiring intrigue and indirect methods (as in the
preliminaries of the Mexican War), and having held his seat in the
United States Senate until the withdrawal of Louisiana from the
Union, he was, of the two men, more feared and more detested, but
both were thoroughly obnoxious to the North. Merely on the personal
side their capture was cause for wide rejoicing<a name=
"FNanchor404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404">[404]</a>.</p>
<p>Surprise was also an element in the American elation, for until
the news of the capture was received no portion of the public had
given serious thought to any attempt to stop the envoys. Surprise
also played its part when the affair became known in England,
though in official circles there had been some warning. It had
already been reported in the British press that Mason and Slidell
had run the blockade at Charleston, were in Cuba, and were about to
set sail for England on the Confederate steamer <i>Nashville</i>,
but the British Government, considering that the envoys might
perhaps sail rather on the West India Mail Steamer for Southampton,
became much concerned over a possible American interference with
that vessel. On November 9 Hammond sent an urgent enquiry to the
Advocate-General stating the situation, calling attention to the
presence at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207"></a>[V1:pg
207]</span> Southampton of an American war-vessel, and asking
whether this vessel, or any other American man-of-war, "would be
entitled to interfere with the mail steamer if fallen in with
beyond the territorial limits of the United Kingdom, that is beyond
three miles from the British Coast."</p>

<blockquote>"Whether for instance she might cause the West India
Mail Steamer to bring to, might board her, examine her Papers, open
the Mail Bags and examine the contents thereof, examine the luggage
of passengers, seize and carry away Messrs. Mason and Slidell in
person, or seize their Credentials and Instructions and Despatches,
or even put a Prize Crew on board the West India Steamer and carry
her off to a Port of the United States; in other words what would
be the right of the American Cruiser with regard to her passengers
and crew and lawful papers and correspondence on board our packet
on the assumption that the said packet was liable to capture and
confiscation on the ground of carrying enemies' despatches; would
the Cruiser be entitled to carry the packet and all and everything
in her back to America or would she be obliged to land in this
Country or in some near port all the people and all the unseizable
goods<a name="FNanchor405"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_405">[405]</a>?"</blockquote>
<p>Hammond further stated that Russell was anxious to have an
immediate reply, inasmuch as the mail packet was due to arrive in
Southampton on November 12. The opinion of the law officer
consulted is best given in Palmerston's own words in a letter to
Delane, Editor of the <i>Times</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>"<i>94 Piccadilly,<br>
November 11, 1861</i>.</blockquote>
<br>
"MY DEAR DELANE,<br>
<br>
"It may be useful to you to know that the Chancellor, Dr.
Lushington, the three Law Officers, Sir G. Grey, the Duke of
Somerset, and myself, met at the Treasury to-day to consider what
we could properly do about the American cruiser come, no doubt, to
search the West Indian packet <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_208"></a>[V1:pg 208]</span> supposed to be bringing hither
the two Southern envoys; and, much to my regret, it appeared that,
according to the principles of international law laid down in our
courts by Lord Stowell, and practised and enforced by us, a
belligerent has a right to stop and search any neutral not being a
ship of war, and being found on the high seas and being suspected
of carrying enemy's despatches; and that consequently this American
cruiser might, by our own principles of international law, stop the
West Indian packet, search her, and if the Southern men and their
despatches and credentials were found on board, either take them
out, or seize the packet and carry her back to New York for trial.
Such being the opinion of our men learned in the law, we have
determined to do no more than to order the <i>Phaeton</i> frigate
to drop down to Yarmouth Roads and watch the proceedings of the
American within our three-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction,
and to prevent her from exercising within that limit those rights
which we cannot dispute as belonging to her beyond that limit.<br>
<br>
"In the meanwhile the American captain, having got very drunk this
morning at Southampton with some excellent brandy, and finding it
blow heavily at sea, has come to an anchor for the night within
Calshot Castle, at the entrance of the Southampton river.<br>
<br>
"I mention these things for your private information.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<br>
PALMERSTON<a name="FNanchor406"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_406">[406]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Not completely satisfied with this decision as reported to
Delane, and sincerely anxious to avert what he foresaw would be a
difficult situation, Palmerston took the unusual step of writing to
Adams on the next day, November 12, and asking for an interview.
His note took Adams by surprise, but he promptly waited upon
Palmerston, and was told of the latter's disturbance at the
presence of the American ship <i>James Adger</i>, Captain Marchand
commanding, in Southampton Harbour, with the alleged purpose of
stopping the British West India steamer and intercepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"></a>[V1:pg 209]</span> the
journey of Mason and Slidell. Palmerston stated that he "did not
pretend to judge absolutely of the question whether we had a right
to stop a foreign vessel for such a purpose as was indicated," and
he urged on Adams the unwisdom of such an act in any case. "Neither
did the object to be gained seem commensurate with the risk. For it
was surely of no consequence whether one or two more men were added
to the two or three who had already been so long here. They would
scarcely make a difference in the action of the Government after
once having made up its mind<a name="FNanchor407"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_407">[407]</a>."</p>
<p>The interview with Adams, so Palmerston wrote to Delane on the
same day, November 12, was reassuring:</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAR DELANE,<br>
<br>
"I have seen Adams to-day, and he assures me that the American
paddle-wheel was sent to intercept the <i>Nashville</i> if found in
these seas, but not to meddle with any ship under a foreign flag.
He said he had seen the commander, and had advised him to go
straight home; and he believed the steamer to be now on her way
back to the United States. This is a very satisfactory
explanation.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<br>
PALMERSTON<a name="FNanchor408"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_408">[408]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In fact, neither Adams' diary nor his report to Seward recorded
quite the same statement as that here attributed to him by
Palmerston, and this became later, but fortunately after the
question of the <i>Trent</i> had passed off the stage, a matter of
minor dispute. Adams' own statement was that he had told Palmerston
the <i>James Adger</i> was seeking to intercept the
<i>Nashville</i> and "had no instruction" to interfere with a
British Packet--which is not the same as saying that she already
had instructions "not to meddle with any ship <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_210"></a>[V1:pg 210]</span> under a foreign
flag<a name="FNanchor409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409">[409]</a>."
But in any case, it would appear that the British Government had
been warned by its legal advisers that if that which actually
happened in the case of the <i>Trent</i> should occur, English
practice, if followed, would compel acquiescence in it<a name=
"FNanchor410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410">[410]</a>. This is not to
say that a first legal advice thus given on a problematical case
necessarily bound the Government to a fixed line of action, but
that the opinion of the Government was one of "no help for it" if
the case should actually arise is shown by the instructions to
Lyons and by his reaction. On November 16, Hammond wrote to Lyons
stating the opinion of the Law Officers that "we could do nothing
to save the Packet being interfered with outside our three miles;
so Lord Palmerston sent for Adams, who assured him that the
American [the <i>James Adger</i>] had no instructions to meddle
with any ship under English colours ... that her orders were not to
endeavour to take Mason and Slidell out of any ship under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211"></a>[V1:pg 211]</span>
foreign colours<a name="FNanchor411"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_411">[411]</a>." On receipt of this letter subsequent to
the actual seizure of the envoys, Lyons hardly knew what to expect.
He reported Hammond's account to Admiral Milne, writing that the
legal opinion was that "Nothing could be done to save the Packet's
being interfered with outside of the Marine league from the British
Coast"; but he added, "I am not informed that the Law Officers
decided that Mason and Slidell might be taken out of the Packet,
but only that we could not prevent the Packet's being interfered
with," thus previsioning that shift in British legal opinion which
was to come <i>after</i> the event. Meanwhile Lyons was so
uncertain as to what his instructions would be that he thought he
"ought to maintain the greatest reserve here on the matter of the
<i>Trent</i><a name="FNanchor412"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_412">[412]</a>."</p>
<p>This British anxiety and the efforts to prevent a dangerous
complication occurred after the envoys had been seized but some two
weeks before that fact was known in London. "Adams," wrote Russell,
"says it was all a false alarm, and wonders at our susceptibility
and exaggerated notions<a name="FNanchor413"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_413">[413]</a>." But Russell was not equally convinced
with Adams that the North, especially Seward, was so eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"></a>[V1:pg 212]</span> for
continued British neutrality, and when, on November 27, the news of
Captain Wilkes' action was received, Russell and many others in the
Cabinet saw in it a continuation of unfriendly Northern policy now
culminating in a direct affront. Argyll, the most avowed friend of
the North in the Cabinet, was stirred at first to keen resentment,
writing "of this wretched piece of American folly.... I am all
against submitting to any clean breach of International Law, such
as I can hardly doubt this has been<a name=
"FNanchor414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414">[414]</a>." The Law
Officers now held that "Captain Wilkes had undertaken to pass upon
the issue of a violation of neutrality on the spot, instead of
sending the <i>Trent</i> as a prize into port for judicial
adjudication<a name="FNanchor415"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_415">[415]</a>." This was still later further expanded
by an opinion that the envoys could not be considered as
contraband, and thus subject to capture nor the <i>Trent</i> as
having violated neutrality, since the destination of the vessel was
to a neutral, not to an enemy port<a name=
"FNanchor416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416">[416]</a>. This opinion
would have prohibited even the carrying of the <i>Trent</i> into an
American port for trial by a prize court.</p>
<p>But the British Government did not argue the matter in its
demand upon the United States. The case was one for a quick demand
of prompt reparation. Russell's instruction to Lyons, sent on
November 30, was couched in coldly correct language, showing
neither a friendly nor an unfriendly attitude. The seizure of the
envoys was asserted to be a breach of international law, which, it
was hoped, had occurred without orders, and Lyons was to demand the
restoration of the prisoners with an apology. If Seward had not
already offered these terms Lyons was to propose them, but as a
preliminary step in making clear the British position, he might
read the instruction to Seward, leaving <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_213"></a>[V1:pg 213]</span> him a copy of
it if desired<a name="FNanchor417"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_417">[417]</a>. In another instruction of the same date
Russell authorized a delay of seven days in insisting upon an
answer by Seward, if the latter wished it, and gave Lyons liberty
to determine whether "the requirements of Her Majesty's Government
are substantially complied with<a name="FNanchor418"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_418">[418]</a>." And on December 1, Russell writing
privately to Lyons instructed him, while upholding English dignity,
to abstain from anything like menace<a name=
"FNanchor419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419">[419]</a>. On November
30, also, the Government hurriedly sent out orders to hold the
British Fleet in readiness, began preparations for the sending of
troops to Canada, and initiated munitions and supply activities.
Evidently there was at first but faint hope that a break in
relations, soon to be followed by war, was to be avoided<a name=
"FNanchor420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420">[420]</a>.</p>
<p>It has long been known to history, and was known to Adams almost
immediately, that the first draft of the instruction to Lyons was
softened in language by the advice of Prince Albert, the material
point being the expression of a hope that the action of Captain
Wilkes was unauthorized<a name="FNanchor421"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_421">[421]</a>. That instruction had been sent previous
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214"></a>[V1:pg 214]</span>
the receipt of a report from Lyons in which, very fearful of
results, he stated that, waiting instructions, he would preserve a
strict silence<a name="FNanchor422"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_422">[422]</a>. Equally anxious was Cowley at Paris, who
feared the realization of Seward's former "foreign war panacea." "I
wish I could divest myself of the idea that the North and South
will not shake hands over a war with us<a name=
"FNanchor423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423">[423]</a>." Considering
the bitterness of the quarrel in America this was a far-fetched
notion. The efforts promptly made by the Confederate agents in
London to make use of the <i>Trent</i> affair showed how little
Cowley understood the American temper. Having remained very quiet
since August when Russell had informed them that Great Britain
intended remaining strictly neutral<a name=
"FNanchor424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424">[424]</a>, they now, on
November 27 and 30, renewed their argument and application for
recognition, but received in reply a curt letter declining any
official communication with them "in the present state of
affairs<a name="FNanchor425"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_425">[425]</a>."</p>
<p>The delay of at least three weeks imposed by methods of
transportation before even the first American reaction to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"></a>[V1:pg 215]</span> the
British demand could be received in London gave time for a
lessening of excitement and a more careful self-analysis by British
statesmen as to what they really felt and desired. Gladstone wrote:
"It is a very sad and heart-sickening business, and I sincerely
trust with you that war may be averted<a name=
"FNanchor426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426">[426]</a>." Argyll
hurried home from the Continent, being much disturbed by the tone
of the British press, and stating that he was against standing on
technical grounds of international law. "War with America is such a
calamity that we must do all we can to avoid it. It involves not
only ourselves, but all our North American colonies<a name=
"FNanchor427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427">[427]</a>." But war
seemed to both men scarcely avoidable, an opinion held also by
Cornewall Lewis<a name="FNanchor428"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_428">[428]</a> and by Clarendon, the latter standing at
the moment in a position midway between the Whig and Tory
parties<a name="FNanchor429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429">[429]</a>.
Yet Russell, with more cause than others to mistrust Seward's
policy, as also believing that he had more cause, personally, to
resent it, was less pessimistic and was already thinking of at
least postponing immediate hostilities in the event of an American
refusal to make just recompense. On December 16 he wrote to
Palmerston: "I incline more and more to the opinion that if the
answer is a reasoning, and not a blunt offensive answer, we should
send once more across the Atlantic to ask compliance.... I do not
think the country would approve an immediate declaration of war.
But I think we must abide by our demand of a restoration of the
prisoners.... Lyons gives a sad account of Canada. Your foresight
of last year is amply justified<a name="FNanchor430"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_430">[430]</a>." And on December 20 he wrote, "Adams'
language yesterday was entirely in favour of yielding to us, if our
tone is not too peremptory.... If our demands are refused, we must,
of course, call Parliament <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_216"></a>[V1:pg 216]</span> together. The sixth of February
will do. In any other case we must decide according to
circumstances<a name="FNanchor431"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_431">[431]</a>."</p>
<p>Thus Russell would not have Great Britain go to war with America
without the sanction of Parliament, and was seeking reasons for
delay. He was reacting, in fact, to a more sobering second thought
which was experienced also by nearly everyone, save the eager
British "Southerner," in public and in newspaper circles. The first
explosion of the Press, on receipt of the news of the <i>Trent</i>,
had been a terrific one. The British lion, insulted in its chosen
field of supremacy, the sea, had pawed the air in frenzy though at
first preserving a certain slow dignity of motion. Customary
"strong leader-writing" became vigorous, indeed, in editorial
treatment of America and in demand for the prompt release of the
envoys with suitable apology. The close touch of leading papers
with Governmental opinion is well shown, as in the <i>Times</i>, by
the day-to-day editorials of the first week. On November 28 there
was solemn and anxious consideration of a grave crisis with much
questioning of international law, which was acknowledged to be
doubtful. But even if old British practice seemed to support
Captain Wilkes, the present was not to be controlled by a discarded
past, and "essential differences" were pointed out. This tone of
vexed uncertainty changed to a note of positive assurance and
militant patriotism on November 30 when the Government made its
demand. The <i>Times</i> up to December 2, thought it absolutely
certain that Wilkes had acted on authorization, and devoted much
space to Seward as the evil genius of American warlike policy
toward England. The old "Duke of Newcastle story" was revamped. But
on December 2 there reached London the first, very brief, American
news of the arrival of the <i>San Jacinto</i> at Fortress Monroe,
and this contained a positive statement by Wilkes that he had had
no orders. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"></a>[V1:pg
217]</span> <i>Times</i> was sceptical, but printed the news as
having an important bearing, if true, and, at the same time,
printed communications by "Justicia" and others advising a "go
slowly" policy<a name="FNanchor432"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_432">[432]</a>. Yet all British papers indulged in sharp
reflections on American insults, displayed keen resentment, and
demanded a prompt yielding to the Governmental demand.</p>
<p>An intelligent American long resident in London, wrote to Seward
on November 29: "There never was within memory such a burst of
feeling as has been created by the news of the boarding of [the
Trent]. The people are frantic with rage, and were the country
polled, I fear 999 men out of a thousand would declare for
immediate war. Lord Palmerston cannot resist the impulse if he
would." And another American, in Edinburgh, wrote to his uncle in
New York: "I have never seen so intense a feeling of indignation
exhibited in my life. It pervades all classes, and may make itself
heard above the wiser theories of the Cabinet officers<a name=
"FNanchor433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433">[433]</a>." If such were
the British temper, it would require skilful handling by even a
pacific-minded Government to avoid war. Even without belligerent
newspaper utterances the tone of arrogance as in <i>Punch's</i>
cartoon, "You do what's right, my son, or I'll blow you out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"></a>[V1:pg 218]</span>
water," portended no happy solution. Yet this cartoon at least
implied a hope of peaceful outcome, and that this was soon a
general hope is shown by the prompt publicity given to a statement
from the American General, Winfield Scott, in Paris, denying that
he had said the action of Captain Wilkes had been decided upon at
Washington before he sailed for Europe, and asserting that no
orders were given to seize the envoys on board any British or
foreign vessel<a name="FNanchor434"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_434">[434]</a>. Nevertheless, Adams, for the moment
intensely aroused, and suspicious of the whole purpose of British
policy, could write to his friend Dana in Boston: "The expression
of the past summer might have convinced you that she [Great
Britain] was not indifferent to the disruption of the Union. In May
she drove in the tip of the wedge, and now you can't imagine that a
few spiders' webs of a half a century back will not be strong
enough to hold her from driving it home. Little do you understand
of this fast-anchored isle<a name="FNanchor435"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_435">[435]</a>."</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that one cause of a more bitter and
sharper tone in the British press was the reception of the
counter-exultation of the American press on learning of the
detention and the exercise of "right of search" on a British ship.
The American public equally went "off its head" in its expressions.
Writing in 1911, the son of the American Minister to Great Britain,
Charles Francis Adams, jun., in 1861, a young law-student in
Boston, stated: "I do not remember in the whole course of the
half-century's retrospect ... any occurrence in which the American
people were so completely swept off their feet, for the moment
losing possession of their senses, as during the weeks which
immediately followed the seizure of Mason and Slidell<a name=
"FNanchor436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436">[436]</a>." There were
evident two principal causes for <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_219"></a>[V1:pg 219]</span> this elation. The North with much
emotion and high courage entering in April, 1861, upon the task of
restoring the Union and hoping for quick success, had now passed
through a wearisome six months with no evident progress towards its
object. Northern failure had developed a deep mortification when,
suddenly and unexpectedly, a bold naval captain, on his own
initiative, appeared to have struck a real blow at the South. His
action seemed to indicate that the fighting forces of the North, if
free from the trammels of Washington red tape, could, and would,
carry on energetic war. Certainly it was but a slight incident to
create such Northern emotion, yet the result was a sudden lifting
from despondency to elation.</p>
<p>But almost equally with this cause of joy there operated on
American minds the notion that the United States had at last given
to Great Britain a dose of her own medicine in a previous era--had
exercised upon a British ship that "right of search" which had been
so keenly resented by America as to have become almost a
<i>permanent</i> cause of a sense of injury once received and never
to be forgotten. There was no clear thinking about this; the
obnoxious right of search in times of peace for vagrant seamen, the
belligerent right exercised by Britain while America was a neutral,
the practice of a "right of visit" claimed by Britain as necessary
in suppression of the African Slave Trade--all were confused by the
American public (as they are still in many history textbooks to
this day), and the total result of this mixing of ideas was a
general American jubilation that the United States had now revenged
herself for British offences, in a manner of which Great Britain
could not consistently complain. These two main reasons for
exultation were shared by all classes, not merely by the uninformed
mob of newspaper readers. At a banquet tendered Captain Wilkes in
Boston on November 26, Governor Andrews of Massachusetts called
Wilkes' action <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220"></a>[V1:pg
220]</span> "one of the most illustrious services that had made the
war memorable," and added "that there might be nothing left [in the
episode] to crown the exultation of the American heart, Commodore
Wilkes fired his shot across the bows of the ship that bore the
British lion at its head<a name="FNanchor437"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_437">[437]</a>."</p>
<p>All America first applauded the act, then plunged into
discussion of its legality as doubts began to arise of its
defensibility--and wisdom. It became a sort of temporarily popular
"parlour game" to argue the international law of the case and
decide that Great Britain could have no cause of complaint<a name=
"FNanchor438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438">[438]</a>. Meanwhile at
Washington itself there was evidenced almost equal excitement and
approval--but not, fortunately, by the Department responsible for
the conduct of foreign relations. Secretary of the Navy Welles
congratulated Wilkes on his "great public service," though
criticizing him for not having brought the <i>Trent</i> into port
for adjudication. Congress passed a joint resolution, December 2,
thanking Wilkes for his conduct, and the President was requested to
give him a gold medal commemorative of his act. Indeed, no evidence
of approbation was withheld save the formal approval and avowal of
national responsibility by the Secretary of State, Seward. On him,
therefore, and on the wisdom of men high in the confidence of the
Cabinet, like Sumner, Lyons pinned his faint hope of a peaceful
solution. Thoroughly alarmed and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_221"></a>[V1:pg 221]</span> despondent, anxious as to the
possible fate of Canada<a name="FNanchor439"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_439">[439]</a>, he advised against any public
preparations in Canada for defence, on the ground that if the
<i>Trent</i> affair did blow over it should not appear that we ever
thought it an insult which would endanger peace<a name=
"FNanchor440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440">[440]</a>. This was very
different from the action and attitude of the Government at home,
as yet unknown to Lyons. He wisely waited in silence, advising like
caution to others, until the receipt of instructions. Silence, at
the moment, was also a friendly service to the United States.</p>
<p>The earliest American reactions, the national rejoicing, became
known to the British press some six days after its own spasm of
anger, and three days after the Government had despatched its
demand for release of the prisoners and begun its hurried military
preparations. On December 3 the <i>Times</i> contained the first
summary of American press outpourings. The first effect in England
was astonishment, followed by renewed and more intense evidences of
a belligerent disposition. Soon, however, there began to appear a
note of caution and more sane judgment of the situation, though
with no lessening of the assertion that Britain had suffered an
injury that must be redressed. The American frenzy of delight
seemingly indicated a deep-seated hostility to Britain that gave
pause to British clamour for revenge. On December 4 John Bright
made a great speech at Rochdale, arguing a possible British
precedent for Wilkes' act, urging caution, lauding American
leadership in democracy, and stating his positive conviction that
the United States Government was as much astonished as was that of
Great Britain by the attack on the <i>Trent.</i><a name=
"FNanchor441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441">[441]</a> To this the
<i>Times</i> gave a full column of report on December 5
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"></a>[V1:pg 222]</span> and
the day following printed five close-type columns of the speech
itself. Editorially it attacked Bright's position, belittling the
speech for having been made at the one "inconspicuous" place where
the orator would be sure of a warm welcome, and asking why
Manchester or Liverpool had not been chosen. In fact, however, the
<i>Times</i> was attempting to controvert "our ancient enemy"
Bright as an apostle of democracy rather than to fan the flames of
irritation over the <i>Trent</i>, and the prominence given to
Bright's speech indicates a greater readiness to consider as
hopeful an escape from the existing crisis.</p>
<p>After December 3 and up to the ninth, the <i>Times</i> was more
caustic about America than previously. The impression of its
editorials read to-day is that more hopeful of a peaceful solution
it was more free to snarl. But with the issue of December 10 there
began a series of leaders and communications, though occasionally
with a relapse to the former tone, distinctly less irritating to
Americans, and indicating a real desire for peace<a name=
"FNanchor442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442">[442]</a>. Other
newspapers either followed the <i>Times</i>, or were slightly in
advance of it in a change to more considerate and peaceful
expressions. Adams could write to Seward on December 6 that he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223"></a>[V1:pg 223]</span> no
change in the universality of the British demand for satisfaction
of the "insult and injury thought to be endured," but he recognized
in the next few days that a slow shift was taking place in the
British temper and regretted the violence of American utterances.
December 12, he wrote to his son in America: "It has given us here
an indescribably sad feeling to witness the exultation in America
over an event which bids fair to be the final calamity in this
contest...." Great Britain "is right in principle and only wrong in
point of consistency. Our mistake is that we are donning ourselves
in her cast-off suit, when our own is better worth wearing<a name=
"FNanchor443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443">[443]</a>." His
secretarial son was more vehement: "Angry and hateful as I am of
Great Britain, I still can't help laughing and cursing at the same
time as I see the accounts of the talk of our people. What a bloody
set of fools they are! How in the name of all that's conceivable
could you suppose that England would sit quiet under such an
insult. <i>We</i> should have jumped out of our boots at such a
one<a name="FNanchor444"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_444">[444]</a>."</p>
<p>The British Cabinet members were divided in sentiments of hope
or pessimism as to the outcome, and were increasingly anxious for
an honourable escape from a possible situation in which, if they
trusted the observations of Lyons, they might find themselves
aiding a slave as against a free State. On November 29, Lyons had
written a long account of the changes taking place in Northern
feeling as regards slavery. He thought it very probable that the
issue of emancipation would soon be forced upon Lincoln, and that
the American conflict would then take on a new and more ideal
character<a name="FNanchor445"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_445">[445]</a>. This letter, arriving in the midst of
uncertainty about the <i>Trent</i> solution, was in line with news
published in the British papers calling out <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_224"></a>[V1:pg 224]</span> editorials from
them largely in disapproval<a name="FNanchor446"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_446">[446]</a>. Certainly Russell was averse to war. If
the prisoners were not given up, what, he asked, ought England then
to do? Would it be wise to delay hostilities or to begin them at
once?</p>
<p>"An early resort to hostilities will enable us at once to raise
the blockade of the South, to blockade the North, and to prevent
the egress of numerous ships, commissioned as privateers which will
be sent against our commerce." But then, there was Canada, at
present not defensible. He had been reading Alison on the War of
1812, and found that then the American army of invasion had
numbered but 2,500 men. "We may now expect 40 or 50,000<a name=
"FNanchor447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447">[447]</a>." Two days
later he wrote to Gladstone that if America would only "let the
Commissioners free to go where they pleased," he would be
satisfied. He added that in that case, "I should be very glad to
make a treaty with the U.S., giving up our pretensions of 1812 and
securing immunity to persons not in arms on board neutral vessels
or to persons going bona fide from one neutral port to another.
This would be a triumph to the U.S. in principle while the
particular case would be decided in our favour<a name=
"FNanchor448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448">[448]</a>."</p>
<p>On Saturday, December 14, the Prince Consort died. It was
well-known that he had long been a brake upon the wheel of
Palmerston's foreign policy and, to the initiated, his last effort
in this direction--the modification of the instruction to Lyons on
the <i>Trent</i>--was no secret. There is no evidence that his
death made any change in the British <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_225"></a>[V1:pg 225]</span> position, but it was true, as the
American Minister wrote, that "Now they [the British public] are
beginning to open their eyes to a sense of his value. They discover
that much of their political quietude has been due to the judicious
exercise of his influence over the Queen and the Court, and they do
not conceal their uneasiness as to the future without him<a name=
"FNanchor449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449">[449]</a>." The nation
was plunged into deep mourning, but not to distraction from the
American crisis, for on the day when all papers were black with
mourning borders, December 16, they printed the news of the
approval of Wilkes by the United States Congress, and gave a
summary of Lincoln's message of December 2, which, to their
astonishment, made no mention of the <i>Trent</i> affair. The
Congressional approval caused "almost a feeling of consternation
among ourselves," but Lincoln's silence, it was argued, might
possibly be taken as a good omen, since it might indicate that he
had as yet reached no decision<a name="FNanchor450"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_450">[450]</a>. Evidently there was more real alarm
caused by the applause given Wilkes by one branch of the government
than by the outpourings of the American press. The next day several
papers printed Lincoln's message in full and the <i>Times</i> gave
a long editorial analysis, showing much spleen that he had ignored
the issue with Great Britain<a name="FNanchor451"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_451">[451]</a>. On the eighteenth this journal also
called attention, in a column and a half editorial, to the report
of the American Secretary of War, expressing astonishment, not
unmixed with anxiety, at the energy which had resulted in the
increase of the army to 700,000 men in less than nine months. The
<i>Times</i> continued, even increased, its "vigour" of utterance
on the <i>Trent</i>, but devoted most of its energy to combating
the suggestions, now being made very generally, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_226"></a>[V1:pg 226]</span> advocating a
recourse to arbitration. This would be "weak concession," and less
likely to secure redress and peace for the future, than an
insistence on the original demands.</p>
<p>Statesmen also were puzzled by Lincoln's silence. Milner Gibson
wrote that "even though Lyons should come away, I think the dispute
may after all be settled without war<a name=
"FNanchor452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452">[452]</a>." Cornewall
Lewis thought the "last mail from America is decidedly threatening,
not encouraging<a name="FNanchor453"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_453">[453]</a>." But on December 19, Adams was at last
able to give Russell official assurance that Wilkes had acted
without authorization. Russell at once informed Lyons of this
communication and that he had now told Adams the exact terms of his
two instructions to Lyons of November 30. He instructed Lyons to
accept in place of an apology an explanation that Wilkes' action
was unauthorized--a very important further British modification,
but one which did not reach Lyons until after the conclusion of the
affair at Washington<a name="FNanchor454"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_454">[454]</a>. Meanwhile a notable change had taken
place in American public expressions. It now regarded "the Wilkes
affair unfavourably, and would much prefer it had not occurred at
all<a name="FNanchor455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455">[455]</a>," a
reaction without question almost wholly caused by the knowledge of
the British demand and the unanimous <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_227"></a>[V1:pg 227]</span> support given it by the British
public<a name="FNanchor456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456">[456]</a>.
On Great Britain the alteration in the American tone produced less
effect than might have been expected, and this because of the
persistent fear and suspicion of Seward. His voice, it was felt,
would in the end be the determining one, and if British belief that
he had long sought an occasion for war was correct, this surely was
the time when he could be confident of popular support. Thurlow
Weed, Seward's most intimate political adviser, was now in London
and attempted to disabuse the British public through the columns of
the <i>Times</i>. His communication was printed, but his assertion
that Seward's unfriendly utterances, beginning with the "Newcastle
story," were misunderstood, did not convince the <i>Times</i>,
which answered him at length<a name="FNanchor457"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_457">[457]</a>, and asserted its belief "... that upon
his ability to involve the United States in a war with England, Mr.
Seward has staked his official, and, most probably, also his
political existence." The Duke of Newcastle's report of Seward's
remarks, wrote George Peabody later, "has strongly influenced the
Government in war preparations for several months past<a name=
"FNanchor458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458">[458]</a>." Adams
himself, though convinced that Seward's supposed animosity "was a
mistake founded on a bad joke of his to the Duke of Newcastle,"
acknowledged <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228"></a>[V1:pg
228]</span> that: "The Duke has, however, succeeded in making
everybody in authority here believe it<a name=
"FNanchor459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459">[459]</a>." Surely no
"joke" to an Englishman ever so plagued an American statesman; but
British Ministers founded their suspicions on far more serious
reasons, as previously related<a name="FNanchor460"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_460">[460]</a>.</p>
<p>As time passed without an answer from America, British
speculation turned to estimates of the probable conditions of a
war. These were not reassuring since even though postulating a
British victory, it appeared inevitable that England would not
escape without considerable damage from the American navy and from
privateers. Americans were "a powerful and adventurous people,
strong in maritime resources, and participating in our own national
familiarity with the risks and dangers of the deep<a name=
"FNanchor461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461">[461]</a>." Englishmen
must not think that a war would be fought only on the shores of
America and in Canada. The legal question was re-hashed and
intelligent American vexation re-stated in three letters printed in
the <i>Daily News</i> on December 25, 26 and 27, by W.W. Story, an
artist resident in Rome, but known in England as the son of Justice
Story, whose fame as a jurist stood high in Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462">[462]</a>. By the last
week of the year Adams felt that the Ministry, at least, was eager
to find a way out: "The Government here will not press the thing to
an extreme unless they are driven to it by the impetus of the wave
they have themselves created<a name="FNanchor463"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_463">[463]</a>." He greatly regretted the death of the
Prince Consort who "believed in the policy of conciliating the
United States instead of repelling them." On December 27, Adams
wrote Seward: "I think the signs are clear of a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_229"></a>[V1:pg 229]</span> considerable
degree of reaction." He also explained the causes of the nearly
unanimous European support of England in this contention:
"Unquestionably the view of all other countries is that the
opportunity is most fortunate for obtaining new and large
modifications of international law which will hereafter materially
restrain the proverbial tendency of this country on the
ocean<a name="FNanchor464"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_464">[464]</a>."</p>
<p>Adams' estimate was correct. Even the <i>Morning Post</i>,
generally accepted as Palmerston's organ<a name=
"FNanchor465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465">[465]</a>, and in the
<i>Trent</i> crisis the most 'vigorous' of all metropolitan
journals, commented upon the general public hope of a peaceful
solution, but asked on December 30, "... can a Government [the
American] elected but a few months since by the popular choice,
depending exclusively for existence on popular support, afford to
disappoint the popular expectation? The answer to this question
must, we fear, be in the negative...." The <i>Post</i> (thereby
Palmerston?) did indeed, as later charged, "prolong the
excitement," but not with its earlier animosity to America. The
very fact that the <i>Post</i> was accepted as Palmerston's organ
justified this attitude for it would have been folly for the
Government to announce prematurely a result of which there was as
yet no definite assurance. Yet <i>within</i> the Cabinet there was
a more hopeful feeling. Argyll believed Adams' statement to Russell
of December 19 was practically conclusive<a name=
"FNanchor466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466">[466]</a>, and Adams
himself now thought that the prevalent idea was waning of an
American plan to inflict persistent "indignities" on Britain: "at
least in this case nothing of the kind had been intended<a name=
"FNanchor467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467">[467]</a>." Everyone
wondered at and was vexed with the delay of an answer from America,
yet hopefully believed that this indicated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_230"></a>[V1:pg 230]</span> ultimate
yielding. There could be no surety until the event. Russell wrote
to Palmerston on January 7, "I still incline to think Lincoln will
submit, but not until the clock is 59 minutes past 11. If it is
war, I fear we must summon Parliament forthwith<a name=
"FNanchor468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468">[468]</a>."</p>
<p>The last moment for reply was indeed very nearly taken advantage
of at Washington, but not to the full seven days permitted for
consideration by Russell's November thirtieth instructions to
Lyons. These were received on December 18, and on the next day
Lyons unofficially acquainted Seward with their nature<a name=
"FNanchor469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469">[469]</a>. The latter
expressed gratification with the "friendly and conciliatory manner"
of Lyons and asked for two days' time for consideration. On
Saturday, December 21, therefore, Lyons again appeared to make a
formal presentation of demands but was met with a statement that
the press of other business had prevented sufficient consideration
and was asked for a further two days' postponement until Monday.
Hence December 23 became the day from which the seven days
permitted for consideration and reply dated. In the meantime,
Mercier, on December 21, had told Seward of the strong support
given by France to the British position.</p>
<p>The month that had elapsed since the American outburst on first
learning of Wilkes' act had given time for a cooling of patriotic
fever and for a saner judgment. Henry Adams in London had written
to his brother that if the prisoners were not given up, "this
nation means to make war." To this the brother in America replied
"this nation doesn't<a name="FNanchor470"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_470">[470]</a>," an answer that sums up public
determination no matter how loud the talk or deep the feeling.
Seward understood <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_231"></a>[V1:pg 231]</span> the change and had now received
strong warnings from Adams and Weed in London, and from Dayton in
Paris<a name="FNanchor471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471">[471]</a>,
but these were not needed to convince him that America must yield.
Apparently, he had recognized from the first that America was in an
impossible situation and that the prisoners must be released <i>if
the demand were made</i>. The comment of those who were "wise after
the event" was that true policy would have dictated an immediate
release of the prisoners as seized in violation of international
law, before any complaint could be received from Great Britain.
This leaves out of consideration the political difficulties at home
of an administration already seriously weakened by a long-continued
failure to "press the war," and it also fails to recognize that in
the American Cabinet itself a proposal by Seward to release, made
immediately, would in all probability have been negatived. Blair,
in the Cabinet, and Sumner in the Senate, were, indeed, in favour
of prompt release, but Lincoln seems to have thought the prisoners
must be held, even though he feared they might become "white
elephants." All that Seward could do at first was to notify Adams
that Wilkes had acted without instructions<a name=
"FNanchor472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472">[472]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232"></a>[V1:pg 232]</span>
<p>On Christmas morning the Cabinet met to consider the answer to
Great Britain. Sumner attended and read letters from Bright and
Cobden, earnestly urging a yielding by America and depicting the
strength of British feeling. Bright wrote: "If you are resolved to
succeed against the South, <i>have no war with England</i>; make
every concession that can be made; don't even hesitate to tell the
world <i>that you will even concede what two years ago no Power
would have asked of you</i>, rather than give another nation a
pretence for assisting in the breaking up of your country<a name=
"FNanchor473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473">[473]</a>." Without doubt
Bright's letters had great influence on Lincoln and on other
Cabinet members, greatly aiding Seward, but that his task was
difficult is shown by the fact that an entire morning's discussion
brought no conclusion. Adjournment was taken until the next day and
after another long debate Seward had the fortune to persuade his
associates to a hearty unanimity on December 26. The American reply
in the form of a communication to Lyons was presented to him by
Seward on the 27th, and on that same day Lyons forwarded it to
Russell. It did not contain an apology, but Lyons wrote that since
the prisoners were to be released and acknowledgment was made that
reparation was due to Great Britain, he considered that British
demands were "so far substantially complied with" that he should
remain at his post until he received further orders<a name=
"FNanchor474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474">[474]</a>.</p>
<p>Seward's reply was immediately printed in the American papers.
Lyons reported that it was very well received and that the public
was calm and apparently contented with the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_233"></a>[V1:pg 233]</span> outcome<a name=
"FNanchor475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475">[475]</a>. He thought
that "thus the preparation for war ... has prevented war." Seward's
argument reviewed at great length all the conditions of the
incident, dilated on many points of international law both relevant
and irrelevant, narrated the past relations of the two nations on
"right of search," and finally took the ground that Mason and
Slidell were contraband of war and justly subject to capture, but
that Wilkes had erred in not bringing the <i>Trent</i>, with her
passengers, into port for trial by an American prize court.
Therefore the two envoys with their secretaries would be handed
over promptly to such persons as Lyons might designate. It was,
says Seward's biographer, not a great state paper, was defective in
argument, and contained many contradictions<a name=
"FNanchor476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476">[476]</a>, but, he adds,
that it was intended primarily for the American public and to meet
the situation at home. Another critic sums up Seward's
difficulties: he had to persuade a President and a reluctant
Cabinet, to support the naval idol of the day, to reconcile a
Congress which had passed resolutions highly commending Wilkes, and
to pacify a public earlier worked up to fever pitch<a name=
"FNanchor477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477">[477]</a>. Still more
important than ill-founded assertions about the nature of
contraband of war, a term not reconcilable with the <i>neutral
port</i> destination of the <i>Trent</i>, was the likening of Mason
and Slidell to "ambassadors of independent states." For eight
months Seward had protested to Europe "that the Confederates were
not belligerents, but insurgents," and now "his whole argument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"></a>[V1:pg 234]</span>
rested on the fact that they were belligerents<a name=
"FNanchor478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478">[478]</a>.... But this
did not later alter a return to his old position nor prevent
renewed arguments to induce a recall by European states of their
proclamations of neutrality.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 8, a telegram from Lyons was
received in London, stating that the envoys would be released and
the next day came his despatch enclosing a copy of Seward's answer.
The envoys themselves did not reach England until January 30, and
the delay in their voyage gave time for an almost complete
disappearance of public interest in them<a name=
"FNanchor479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479">[479]</a>. January 10,
Russell instructed Lyons that Great Britain was well satisfied with
the fact and manner of the American answer, and regarded the
incident as closed, but that it could not agree with portions of
Seward's argument and would answer these later. This was done on
January 23, but the reply was mainly a mere formality and is of
interest only as revealing a further shift in the opinion of the
legal advisers, with emphasis on the question of what constitutes
contraband<a name="FNanchor480"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_480">[480]</a>. Possibly the British Government was
embarrassed by the fact that while France had strongly supported
England at Washington, Thouvenel had told Cowley "... that the
conduct pursued by Capt. Wilkes, whether the United States claimed
to be considered as Belligerents, <i>or as a Government engaged in
putting down a rebellion</i>, was a violation of all those
principles of Maritime international law, which France had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"></a>[V1:pg 235]</span>
ever supported<a name="FNanchor481"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_481">[481]</a> ..." and had instructed Mercier to so
state to Seward. This implied a reflection on former British
practice, especially as regards the exercise of a right of search
to recover its own citizens and is indicative of the correctness of
Adams' judgment that one main reason for European support of Great
Britain in the <i>Trent</i> crisis, was the general desire to tie
her to a limitation of belligerent maritime power.</p>
<p>In notifying Russell of the release of the prisoners, Lyons had
stated that he would caution the Commander of the ship conveying
them that they were "not to be received with honours or treated
otherwise than as distinguished <i>private</i> gentlemen<a name=
"FNanchor482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482">[482]</a>." Russell was
equally cautious, seeing Mason, shortly after arrival in London,
"unofficially at my own house," on February 10, refusing to read
his credentials, and after listening to a statement of his
instructions, replying that "nothing had hitherto occurred which
would justify or induce" Great Britain to depart from a position of
neutrality<a name="FNanchor483"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_483">[483]</a>. Russell had already suggested that
Thouvenel use the same method with Slidell<a name=
"FNanchor484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484">[484]</a>. This procedure
does not necessarily indicate a change in governmental attitude,
for it is exactly in line with that pursued toward the Confederate
Commissioners before the <i>Trent</i>; but the <i>Trent</i>
controversy might naturally have been expected to have brought
about an <i>easier</i> relation between Russell and a Southern
representative. That it did not do so is evidence of Russell's care
not to give offence to Northern susceptibilities. Also, in relief
at the outcome of the <i>Trent</i>, he was convinced, momentarily
at least, that the general British suspicion of Seward was
unfounded. "I do not," he wrote to Gladstone, "believe that Seward
has any animosity <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_236"></a>[V1:pg 236]</span> to this country. It is all
buncom" (<i>sic</i>)<a name="FNanchor485"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_485">[485]</a>. Apparently it was beginning to be
realized by British statesmen that Seward's "high tone" which they
had interpreted, with some justification earlier, as especially
inimical to England, now indicated a foreign policy based upon one
object only--the restoration of the Union, and that in pursuit of
this object he was but seeking to make clear to European nations
that the United States was still powerful enough to resent foreign
interference. The final decision in the <i>Trent</i> affair, such
was the situation in the American Cabinet, rested on Seward alone
and that decision was, from the first, for peace.</p>
<p>Nor did Seward later hold any grudge over the outcome. America
in general, however, though breathing freely again as the war cloud
passed, was bitter. "The feeling against Great Britain is of
intense hatred and the conclusion of the whole matter is, that we
must give up the traitors, put down the rebellion, increase our
navy, perfect the discipline of the 600,000 men in the field, and
then fight Great Britain<a name="FNanchor486"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_486">[486]</a>." Lowell, in one of the most emotional of
his "Bigelow Papers," wrote, on January 6, 1862:</p>
<blockquote>"It don't seem hardly right, John,<br>
When both my hands was full,<br>
To stump me to a fight, John--<br>
Your cousin, tu, John Bull!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ole Uncle S., sez he, 'I guess<br>
We know it now,' sez he,<br>
'The lion's paw is all the law,<br>
Accordin' to J.B.,<br>
Thet's fit for you an' me<a name="FNanchor487"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_487">[487]</a>!'"</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"></a>[V1:pg 237]</span>
<p>It was not the demand itself for the release of Mason and
Slidell that in the end so stirred America as the warlike tone of
the British press and the preparations of the Government. Even
after their surrender America was further incensed by British
boasting that America had yielded to a threat of war, as in the
<i>Punch</i> cartoon of a penitent small boy, Uncle Sam, who "says
he is very sorry and that he didn't mean to do it," and so escapes
the birching Britannia was about to administer. America had, in all
truth, yielded to a threat, but disliked being told so, and
regarded the threat itself as evidence of British ill-will<a name=
"FNanchor488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488">[488]</a>. This was long
the attitude of the American public.</p>
<p>In England the knowledge of America's decision caused a great
national sigh of relief, coupled with a determination to turn the
cold shoulder to the released envoys. On January 11, the
<i>Times</i> recounted the earlier careers of Mason and Slidell,
and stated that these two "more than any other men," were
responsible for the traditional American "insane prejudice against
England," an assertion for which no facts were offered in proof,
and one much overestimating the influence of Mason and Slidell on
American politics before secession. They were "about the most
worthless booty it would be possible to extract from the jaws of
the American lion ... So we do sincerely hope that our countrymen
will not give these fellows anything in the shape of an ovation."
Continuing, the <i>Times</i> argued:</p>
<blockquote>"What they and their secretaries are to do here passes
our conjecture. They are personally nothing to us. They must not
suppose, because we have gone to the very verge of a great war to
rescue them, that therefore they are <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_238"></a>[V1:pg 238]</span> precious in our eyes. We should
have done just as much to rescue two of their own Negroes, and, had
that been the object of the rescue, the swarthy Pompey and Caesar
would have had just the same right to triumphal arches and
municipal addresses as Messrs. Mason and Slidell. So, please,
British public, let's have none of these things. Let the
Commissioners come up quietly to town, and have their say with
anybody who may have time to listen to them. For our part, we
cannot see how anything they have to tell can turn the scale of
British duty and deliberation."</blockquote>
<p>This complete reversal, not to say somersault, by the leading
British newspaper, was in line with public expressions from all
sections save the extreme pro-Southern. Adams was astonished,
writing privately: "The first effect of the surrender ... has been
extraordinary. The current which ran against us with such extreme
violence six weeks ago now seems to be going with equal fury in our
favour<a name="FNanchor489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489">[489]</a>."
Officially on the same day he explained this to Seward as caused by
a late development in the crisis of a full understanding,
especially "among the quiet and religious citizens of the middle
classes," that if Great Britain did engage in war with the United
States she would be forced to become the ally of a "slave-holding
oligarchy<a name="FNanchor490"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_490">[490]</a>."</p>
<p>Here, in truth, lay the greatest cause of British anxiety during
the period of waiting for an answer and of relief when that answer
was received. If England and America became enemies, wrote Argyll,
"we necessarily became virtually the <i>Allies</i> of the
<i>Scoundrelism</i> of the South<a name="FNanchor491"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_491">[491]</a>." Robert Browning, attempting to explain
to his friend Story the British attitude, declared that early in
the war Britain was with the North, expecting "that the pure and
simple rights [of anti-slavery] in the case would be declared and
vigorously carried out without one let or stop," but <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_239"></a>[V1:pg 239]</span> that Lincoln's
denial of emancipation as an object had largely destroyed this
sympathy. Browning thought this an excusable though a mistaken
judgment since at least: "The <i>spirit</i> of all of Mr. Lincoln's
acts is altogether against Slavery in the end<a name=
"FNanchor492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492">[492]</a>." He assured
Story that the latter was in error "as to men's 'fury' here": "I
have not heard one man, woman or child express anything but dismay
at the prospect of being obliged to go to war on any grounds with
America<a name="FNanchor493"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_493">[493]</a>." And after the affair was over he
affirmed: "The purpose of the North is also understood at last; ...
there is no longer the notion that 'Slavery has nothing to do with
it<a name="FNanchor494"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_494">[494]</a>.'"</p>
<p>A few extreme pro-Northern enthusiasts held public meetings and
passed resolutions commending the "statesmanlike ability and
moderation of Seward," and rejoicing that Great Britain had not
taken sides with a slave power<a name="FNanchor495"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_495">[495]</a>. In general, however, such sentiments
were not <i>publicly</i> expressed. That they were keenly felt,
nevertheless, is certain. During the height of the crisis, Anthony
Trollope, then touring America, even while sharing fully in the
intense British indignation against Captain Wilkes, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"These people speak our language, use our prayers, read
our books, are ruled by our laws, dress themselves in our image,
are warm with our blood. They have all our virtues; and their vices
are our own too, loudly as we call out against them. They are our
sons and our daughters, the source of our greatest pride, and as we
grow old they should be the staff of our age. Such a war as we
should now wage with the States would be an unloosing of hell upon
all that is best upon the world's surface<a name=
"FNanchor496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496">[496]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240"></a>[V1:pg 240]</span>
<p>The expressions of men like Browning and Trollope may not
indeed, be regarded as typical of either governmental or general
public reactions. Much more exactly and with more authority as
representing that thoughtful opinion of which Adams wrote were the
conclusions of John Stuart Mill. In an article in <i>Fraser's
Magazine</i>, February, 1862, making a strong plea for the North,
he summarized British feeling about the <i>Trent</i>:</p>
<blockquote>"We had indeed, been wronged. We had suffered an
indignity, and something more than an indignity, which, not to have
resented, would have been to invite a constant succession of
insults and injuries from the same and from every other quarter. We
could have acted no otherwise than we have done; yet it is
impossible to think, without something like a shudder, from what we
have escaped. We, the emancipators of the slave--who have wearied
every Court and Government in Europe and America with our protests
and remonstrances, until we goaded them into at least ostensibly
co-operating with us to prevent the enslaving of the negro ...
<i>we</i> should have lent a hand to setting up, in one of the most
commanding positions of the world, a powerful republic, devoted not
only to slavery, but to pro-slavery propagandism...."</blockquote>
<p>No such protestations of relief over escape from a possible
alliance with the South were made officially by the Government, or
in a debate upon the <i>Trent</i>, February 6, when Parliament
reassembled. In the Lords the Earl of Shelburne thought that
America should have made a frank and open apology. The Earl of
Derby twitted the United States with having yielded to force alone,
but said the time "had not yet come" for recognizing the
Confederacy. Lord Dufferin expressed great friendship for America
and declared that Englishmen ought to make themselves better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241"></a>[V1:pg 241]</span>
informed of the real merits of the Civil War. Earl Granville,
speaking for the Government, laid stress upon the difficulties at
home of the Washington administration in pacifying public opinion
and asserted a personal belief that strict neutrality was England's
best policy, "although circumstances may arise which may call for a
different course." On the same day in the Commons the debate was of
a like general tenor to that in the Lords, but Disraeli differed
from his chief (Derby) in that he thought America had been placed
in a very difficult position in which she had acted very
honourably. Palmerston took much credit for the energetic military
preparations, but stated "from that position of strict neutrality,
it is not our intention to depart "--an important declaration if
taken, as apparently it was not, as fixing a policy. In substance
all speakers, whether Whig or Tory, praised the Government's stand,
and expressed gratification with the peaceful outcome<a name=
"FNanchor497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497">[497]</a>.</p>
<p>A further debate on the <i>Trent</i> was precipitated by Bright
on February 17, in connection with the estimates to cover the cost
of the military contingents sent to Canada. He asserted that
England by generously trusting to American honour, might have won
her lasting friendship, and it is worthy of note that for the first
time in any speech made by him <i>in Parliament</i>, Bright
declared that the war was one for the abolition of slavery.
Palmerston in reply made no comment on the matter of slavery, but
energetically defended the military preparations as a necessary
precaution. Bright's speech was probably intended for American
consumption with the purpose of easing American ill-will, by
showing that even in Parliament there were those who disapproved of
that show of force to which America so much objected. He foresaw
that this would long be the basis of American bitterness. But
Palmerston was undoubtedly <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_242"></a>[V1:pg 242]</span> correct in characterizing
Bright's opinion as a "solitary one." And looked at from a distance
of time it would seem that a British Government, impressed as it
was with a sense of Seward's unfriendliness, which had not prepared
for war when making so strong a demand for reparation, would have
merited the heaviest condemnation. If Mill was right in stating
that the demand for reparation was a necessity, then so also were
the military preparations.</p>
<p>Upon the Government the <i>Trent</i> acted to bring to a head
and make more clear the British relation to the Civil War in
America. By November, 1861, the policy of strict neutrality adopted
in May, had begun to be weakened for various reasons already
recited--weakened not to the point of any Cabinet member's advocacy
of change, but in a restlessness at the slow development of a
solution in America. Russell was beginning to <i>think</i>, at
least, of recognition of the Confederacy. This was clear to Lyons
who, though against such recognition, had understood the drift, if
Schleiden is to be trusted, of Ministerial opinion. Schleiden
reported on December 31 that Lyons had expressed to him much
pleasure at the peaceful conclusion of the <i>Trent</i> affair, and
had added, "England will be too generous not to postpone the
recognition of the independence of the South as long as possible
after this experience<a name="FNanchor498"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_498">[498]</a>." But the <i>Trent</i> operated like a
thunder-storm to clear the atmosphere. It brought out plainly the
practical difficulties and dangers, at least as regards Canada, of
a war with America; it resulted in a weakening of the conviction
that Seward was unfriendly; it produced from the British public an
even greater expression of relief, when the incident was closed,
than of anger when it occurred; and it created in a section of that
public a fixed belief, shared by at least one member of the
Cabinet, that the issue in America was that of slavery, in support
of which England could not possibly take a stand.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243"></a>[V1:pg 243]</span>
<p>This did not mean that the British Government, nor any large
section of the public, believed the North could conquer the South.
But it did indicate a renewed vigour for the policy of neutrality
and a determination not to get into war with America. Adams wrote
to Seward, "I am inclined to believe that the happening of the
affair of the <i>Trent</i> just when it did, with just the issue
that it had, was rather opportune than otherwise<a name=
"FNanchor499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499">[499]</a>." Hotze, the
confidential agent of the Confederacy in London, stated, "the
<i>Trent</i> affair has done us incalculable injury," Russell is
now "an avowed enemy of our nationality<a name=
"FNanchor500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500">[500]</a>." Hotze was
over-gloomy, but Russell himself declared to Lyons: "At all events
I am heart and soul a neutral ... what a fuss we have had about
these two men<a name="FNanchor501"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_501">[501]</a>."</p>
<br>
<blockquote>FOOTNOTES:</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_399"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor399">[399]</a> The <i>Trent</i> was the cause of the
outpouring of more contemporary articles and pamphlets and has been
the subject of more historical writing later, than any other
incident of diplomatic relations between the United States and
Great Britain during the Civil War--possibly more than all other
incidents combined. The account given in this chapter, therefore,
is mainly limited to a brief statement of the facts together with
such new sidelights as are brought out by hitherto unknown letters
of British statesman; to a summary of British public attitude as
shown in the press; and to an estimate of the <i>after effect</i>
of the <i>Trent</i> on British policy. It would be of no service to
list all of the writings. The incident is thoroughly discussed in
all histories, whether British or American and in works devoted to
international law. The contemporary American view is well stated,
though from a strongly anti-British point of view, in Harris, T.L.,
<i>The Trent Affair</i>, but this monograph is lacking in exact
reference for its many citations and can not be accepted as
authoritative. The latest review is that of C.F. Adams in the
<i>Proceedings</i> of the Massachusetts Historical Society for
November, 1911, which called out a reply from R.H. Dana, and a
rejoinder by Mr. Adams in the <i>Proceedings</i> for March,
1912.</blockquote>

"#FNanchor409">[409]</a> A full year later, after the publication
of the American volume of despatches for the year 1862, Russell
took up this matter with Adams and as a result of an interview
wrote to Lyons, November 28, 1862:<br>
<br>
"Lord Palmerston stated to Mr. Adams on the occasion in question
that Her Majesty's Government could not permit any interference
with any vessel, British or Foreign, within British waters; that
with regard to vessels met with at sea, Her Majesty's Government
did not mean to dispute the Belligerent right of the United States
Ships of War to search them; but that the exercise of that right
and the right of detention in certain conditions must in each case
be dealt with according to the circumstances of the case, and that
it was not necessary for him to discuss such matters then because
they were not in point; but that it would not do for the United
States Ships of War to harass British Commerce on the High Seas
under the pretence of preventing the Confederates from receiving
things that are Contraband of War.<br>
<br>
"I took an opportunity of mentioning to Mr. Adams, the account
which Lord Palmerston had given me of the language which he had
thus held, and Mr. Adams agreed in its accuracy.<br>
<br>
"Nothing must be said on this Subject unless the false statements
as to Lord Palmerston's language should be renewed, when you will
state the real facts to Mr. Seward." (F.O., Am., Vol. 822. No. 295.
<i>Draft</i>.)<br>
<br>
This r&eacute;sum&eacute; by Russell contained still other
variations from the original reports of both Palmerston and Adams,
but the latter did not think it worth while to call attention to
them.</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_410"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor410">[410]</a> Walpole, <i>Russell</i>, II, p. 357, is
evidently in error in stating that the law officers, while
admitting the right of an American war vessel to carry the British
Packet into an American port for adjudication, added, "she would
have no right to remove Messrs. Mason and Slidell and carry them
off as prisoners, leaving the ship to pursue her voyage." Certainly
Palmerston did not so understand the advice given.</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_411"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor411">[411]</a> Lyons Papers. Hammond to Lyons. F.O.,
Private. Nov. 16, 1861. This statement about explicit orders to
Captain Marchand "not to endeavour, etc.," is in line with
Palmerston's understanding of the conversation with Adams. But that
there was carelessness in reporting Adams is evident from Hammond's
own language for "no instructions to meddle," which Adams did
state, is not the same thing as "instructions not to meddle." Adams
had no intent to deceive, but was misunderstood. He was himself
very anxious over the presence of the <i>James Adger</i> at
Southampton, and hurried her Captain away. Adams informed Russell
that Palmerston had not understood him correctly. He had told
Palmerston, "I had seen the Captain's [Marchand's] instructions,
which directed him to intercept the <i>Nashville</i> if he could,
and in case of inability to do so, to return at once to New York,
keeping his eye on such British ships as might be going to the
United States with contraband of war. Lord Palmerston's
recollections and mine differed mainly in this last particular.
Lord Russell then remarked that this statement was exactly that
which he had recollected my making to him. Nothing had been said in
the instructions about other British ships." (State Dept., Eng.,
Vol. 78. No. 80. Adams to Seward. Nov. 29. 1861.) Hammond's letter
mentions also the excitement of "the Southerners" in England and
that they had "sent out Pilot Boats to intercept and warn the
Packet...."</blockquote>

"#FNanchor420">[420]</a> Troops were in fact shipped for Canada.
This resulted, after the <i>Trent</i> affair had blown over, in a
circumstance which permitted Seward, with keen delight, to extend a
courtesy to Great Britain. Bancroft (II, 245) states that these
troops "finding the St. Lawrence river full of ice, had entered
Portland harbour. When permission was asked for them to cross
Maine, Seward promptly ordered that all facilities should be
granted for 'landing and transporting to Canada or elsewhere
troops, stores, and munitions of war of every kind without
exception or reservation.'" It is true that the American press made
much of this, and in tones of derision. The facts, as reported by
Lyons, were that the request was merely "a superfluous application
from a private firm at Montreal for permission to land some
Officers' Baggage at Portland." (Russell Papers, Lyons to Russell,
Jan. 20, 1862.) Lyons was much vexed with this "trick" of Seward's.
He wrote to the Governor-General of Canada and the
Lieutenant-Governors of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, protesting
against an acceptance of Seward's permission, and finally informed
Russell that no English troops were marched across the State of
Maine. (Russell Papers. Lyons to Russell, Feb. 14, 1862. Also Lyons
Papers. Lyons to Monck, Feb. 1, 1862.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_422"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor422">[422]</a> Still another letter from Russell to Lyons
on November 30, but not intended for Seward, outlined the points of
complaint and argument, (1) The <i>San Jacinto</i> did not happen
to fall in with the <i>Trent</i>, but laid in wait for her. (2)
"Unnecessary and dangerous Acts of violence" were used. (3) The
<i>Trent</i>, when stopped was not "searched" in the "ordinary
way," but "certain Passengers" were demanded and taken by force.
(4) No charge was made that the <i>Trent</i> was violating
neutrality, and no authority for his act was offered by Captain
Wilkes. (5) No force ought to be used against an
"<i>unresisting</i> Neutral Ship" except just so much as is
necessary to bring her before a prize court. (6) In the present
case the British vessel had done nothing, and intended nothing,
warranting even an inquiry by a prize court. (7) "It is essential
for British Interests, that consistently with the obligations of
neutrality, and of observing any <i>legal</i> and <i>effective</i>
blockade, there should be communication between the Dominions of
Her Majesty and the Countries forming the Confederate States."
These seven points were for Lyons' eye alone. They certainly add no
strength to the British position and reflect the uncertainty and
confusion of the Cabinet. The fifth and sixth points contain the
essence of what, on more mature reflection, was to be the British
argument. (F.O., Am., Vol. 758. No. 447. Draft. Russell to Lyons
Nov. 30, 1861).</blockquote>

himself at one with the <i>Times</i> in suspicion of Seward. "I
confess I have not much opinion of Seward. He is a kind of American
Thiers or Palmerston or Russell--and talks Bunkum. Fortunately, my
friend Mr. Charles Sumner, who is Chairman of the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations, and has really a kind of veto on the acts of
Seward, is a very peaceable and safe man." <i>(ibid.</i>, p. 386,
to Lieut.-Col. Fitzmayer, Dec. 3, 1861.) It is interesting that
Canadian opinion regarded the <i>Times</i> as the great cause of
American ill-will toward Britain. A letter to Gait asserted that
the "war talk" was all a "farce" (J.H. Pope to Gait, Dec. 26, 1861)
and the Toronto <i>Globe</i> attacked the <i>Times</i> for the
creation of bad feeling. The general attitude was that if
<i>British</i> policy resulted in an American blow at Canada, it
was a British, not a Canadian duty, to maintain her defence
(Skelton, <i>Life of Sir Alexander Tilloch Gait</i>, pp. 340, 348.)
Yet the author states that in the beginning Canada went through the
same phases of feeling on the <i>Trent</i> as did Great
Britain.</blockquote>

Russian fleets whose commanders let it be understood that they had
come under "sealed orders" not to be opened except in a certain
grave event and that their presence was, at least, not an
unfriendly indication of Russian sentiment in the <i>Trent</i>
crisis. This is asserted to have bolstered American courage and to
give warrant for the argument that America finally yielded to Great
Britain from no fear of consequences, but merely on a clearer
recognition of the justice of the case. In fact the story is wholly
a myth. The Russian fleets appeared two years later in the fall of
1863, not in 1861. Harris, <i>The Trent Affair,</i> pp. 208-10, is
mainly responsible for this story, quoting the inaccurate memory of
Thurlow Weed. (<i>Autobiography</i>, II, pp. 346-7.) Reliable
historians like Rhodes make no mention of such an incident. The
whole story of the Russian fleets with their exact instructions is

"#FNanchor472">[472]</a> Much ink has flowed to prove that
Lincoln's was the wise view, seeing from the first the necessity of
giving up Mason and Slidell, and that he overrode Seward, e.g.,
Welles, <i>Lincoln and Seward</i>, and Harris, <i>The Trent
Affair</i>. Rhodes, III, pp. 522-24, and Bancroft, <i>Seward</i>,
II, pp. 232-37, disprove this. Yet the general contemporary
suspicion of Seward's "anti-British policy," even in Washington, is
shown by a despatch sent by Schleiden to the Senate of Bremen. On
December 23 he wrote that letters from Cobden and Lyndhurst had
been seen by Lincoln.<br>
<br>
"Both letters have been submitted to the President. He returned
them with the remark that 'peace will not be broken if England is
not bent on war.' At the same time the President has assured my
informant that he would examine the answer of his Secretary of
State, word for word, in order that no expression should remain
which could create bad blood anew, because the strong language
which Mr. Seward had used in some of his former despatches seems to
have irritated and insulted England" (Schleiden Papers). No doubt
Sumner was Schleiden's informant. At first glance Lincoln's
reported language would seem to imply that he was putting pressure
on Seward to release the prisoners and Schleiden apparently so
interpreted them. But the fact was that at the date when this was
written Lincoln had not yet committed himself to accepting Seward's
view. He told Seward, "You will go on, of course, preparing your
answer, which, as I understood it, will state the reasons why they
ought to be given up. Now, I have a mind to try my hand at stating
the reasons why they ought <i>not</i> to be given up. We will
compare the points on each side." Lincoln's idea was, in short, to
return an answer to Great Britain, proposing arbitration (Bancroft,
<i>Seward</i>, II, 234).</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE BLOCKADE</h3>
<br>
<p>The six months following the affair of the <i>Trent</i>
constituted a period of comparative calm in the relations of Great
Britain and America, but throughout that period there was steadily
coming to the front a Northern belligerent effort increasingly
effective, increasingly a cause for disturbance to British trade,
and therefore more and more a matter for anxious governmental
consideration. This was the blockade of Southern ports and coast
line, which Lincoln had declared <i>in intention</i> in his
proclamation of April 19, 1861.</p>
<p>As early as December, 1860, Lyons had raised the question of the
relation of British ships and merchants to the secession port of
Charleston, South Carolina, and had received from Judge Black an
evasive reply<a name="FNanchor502"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_502">[502]</a>. In March, 1861, Russell had foreseen the
possibility of a blockade, writing to Lyons that American precedent
would at least require it to be an effective one, while Lyons made
great efforts to convince Seward that <i>any</i> interference with
British trade would be disastrous to the Northern cause in England.
He even went so far as to hint at British intervention to preserve
trade<a name="FNanchor503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503">[503]</a>.
But on April 15, Lyons, while believing that no effective blockade
was possible, thought that the attempt to institute one was less
objectionable than legislation "closing the Southern Ports as Ports
of Entry," in reality a mere paper blockade and one which would
"justify Great Britain and France in recognizing the Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245"></a>[V1:pg 245]</span>
Confederacy...." Thus he began to weaken in opposition to
<i>any</i> interference<a name="FNanchor504"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_504">[504]</a>. His earlier expressions to Seward were
but arguments, without committing his Government to a line of
policy, and were intended to make Seward step cautiously.</p>
<p>Possibly Lyons thought he could frighten the North out of a
blockade campaign. But when the Civil War actually began and
Lincoln, on April 19, declared he had "deemed it advisable to set
on foot a blockade," and that when a "competent force" had been
posted "so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels," warning
would be given to any vessel attempting to enter or to leave a
blockaded port, with endorsement on her register of such warning,
followed by seizure if she again attempted to pass the blockade,
Lyons felt that: "If it be carried on, with reasonable
consideration for Foreign Flags, and in strict conformity with the
Law of Nations, I suppose it must be recognized<a name=
"FNanchor505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505">[505]</a>." The
Proclamation named the original seven seceding states, and on April
27 Virginia was added. The blockade was actually begun at certain
Virginia ports on April 30, and by the end of May there were a few
war-ships off all the more important Southern harbours<a name=
"FNanchor506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506">[506]</a>. This method of
putting a blockade into effect by warning at the port rather than
by a general notification communicated to European governments and
setting a date, involved a hardship on British merchants since they
were thereby made uncertain whether goods started for a Southern
port would be permitted to enter. In practice vessels on their
first departure from a blockaded harbour were warned and permitted
to go out, but those seeking to enter were warned and turned back.
In <i>effect</i>, while the blockade was being established,
Lincoln's Proclamation had something of the nature for <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_246"></a>[V1:pg 246]</span> the timid
British merchant, though not for the bold one, of a paper blockade.
This was not clearly understood by Lyons, who thought neutrals must
acquiesce, having "exhausted every possible means of opposition,"
but who consoled himself with the idea that "for some time yet"
British trade could be carried on<a name="FNanchor507"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_507">[507]</a>.</p>
<p>Lyons was in fact sceptical, as he told Seward in a long
conversation on April 29 of the possibility of blockading a 3,000
mile coast line, but Seward assured him it would be done and
effectively<a name="FNanchor508"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_508">[508]</a>. The British press was equally sceptical,
and in any case believed that the war would be of short duration,
so that there need be no anxiety over next year's supply of
cotton<a name="FNanchor509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509">[509]</a>.
In Parliament Russell took the stand that the blockade, if carried
on in accordance with international law and made effective,
required British recognition and respect. He also defended
Lincoln's "notification at the port" method, stating that it might
seem a hardship, but was perfectly legal<a name=
"FNanchor510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510">[510]</a>. Thus there was
early and easy acquiescence in the American effort, but when, in
June, there was revived a Northern plan to close Southern ports by
legislative action, Britain was stirred to quick and vigorous
opposition. Lyons learned that a Bill would be introduced in
Congress giving the President authority, among other powers, to
"proclaim" the ports closed, thus notifying foreign nations not to
attempt to use them. He saw in it an unexpected application of the
Northern theory that the South was not a belligerent and had no
rights as such, and he regarded it as in effect a paper
blockade<a name="FNanchor511"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_511">[511]</a>.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the Bill as introduced in Congress did not
direct the President to issue a proclamation closing Southern
ports--it merely gave him the power to do so. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_247"></a>[V1:pg 247]</span> Almost from the
first Lyons thought that Lincoln and Seward were too wise to issue
such a proclamation<a name="FNanchor512"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_512">[512]</a>. Nevertheless it was his duty to be on
guard and to oppose the plan. For six weeks there was much
communication in regard to the "Southern Ports Bill," as all
parties called it, from Russell to Lyons, and also with Cowley in
France. The British Foreign Office interest in the matter, almost
rising to excitement, is somewhat astonishing in view of the small
importance evidently attached to the plan at Washington and the
reluctance of France to be as vigorous as Great Britain in protest.
Vigorous Russell certainly was, using a "high tone" in official
remonstrance to America not unlike that taken by Seward on British
recognition of Southern belligerency.</p>
<p>Immediately on learning of the introduction of the Bill Russell
addressed enquiries to Cowley asking what France intended and urged
a stiff protest. Thouvenel had not heard of the Bill and was
seemingly indifferent. At first he acquiesced in Russell's protest,
then drew back and on three separate occasions promised support
only to withdraw such promise. He was disinclined, said Cowley, to
join in a "friendly hint" to America because of the touchy
sensibilities lately shown by Seward, and feared a direct protest
might result in an American declaration of war. In any case why not
wait until the President <i>did</i> act, and even then the proper
method would be a protest rather than "reprisals." "I wish," wrote
Cowley, on July 28, "that the French were inclined to be more
<i>bumptious</i>, as they seemed to be at first. I would at all
times rather have the task of calming them, than of urging them
on<a name="FNanchor513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513">[513]</a>...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248"></a>[V1:pg 248]</span>
Nevertheless Russell on July 19 notified Lyons that England would
not observe a "legislative closing" of Southern ports<a name=
"FNanchor514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514">[514]</a>. On July 12
Lyons telegraphed that the Bill had passed both Houses of Congress,
and on the sixteenth he wrote privately to Russell that he was much
disturbed over its possible consequences since "even Sumner was for
it<a name="FNanchor515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515">[515]</a>," as
this indicated a real intention to carry it into effect<a name=
"FNanchor516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516">[516]</a>. On August 8,
Russell sent formal instructions of protest, a copy of which was to
be handed to Seward, but the next day authorized Lyons to exercise
discretion as to communicating the despatch<a name=
"FNanchor517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517">[517]</a>.</p>
<p>The original form of this instruction, dated in June and revised
in July, concluded with language that might well draw out
Thouvenel's objection to a threat of "reprisals." It read that
"H.M.G. ... reserve ... the right of acting in concert with other
Nations in opposition to so violent an attack on the rights of
Commercial Countries and so manifest a violation of International
Law<a name="FNanchor518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518">[518]</a>."
This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249"></a>[V1:pg
249]</span> high tone had been modified possibly by French
opposition, possibly by Lyons' early opinion that the Bill would
not be made operative. Indeed on July 24 Russell told Lyons that no
final instruction of protest would be sent him until the President
actually issued a proclamation<a name="FNanchor519"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_519">[519]</a>. Yet in spite of being fairly well
assured that there was no danger in the "Southern Ports Bill,"
Russell did send the instruction of August 8, still distinctly
"vigorous" in tone, though with no threat of "reprisals." His
reason for doing so is difficult to understand. Certainly he was
hardly serious in arguing to Thouvenel that a stiff instruction
would strengthen the hands of the "moderate section" of the
American Cabinet<a name="FNanchor520"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_520">[520]</a>, or else he strangely misjudged American
temperament. Probably a greater reason was his wish to be able to
print a Parliamentary Paper indicating the watchful care he was
exercising in guarding British interests.</p>
<p>Before Russell's instruction could reach America Seward had
voluntarily reassured Lyons as to American intentions. Lyons
reported this, privately, on July 20<a name=
"FNanchor521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521">[521]</a>, but on the
same day also reported, officially, that two days earlier, that is
on the eighteenth, he and Mercier had discussed the "Southern
Ports" Bill and that as a result Mercier had then gone, that same
day, to Seward to state that France must regard such a measure as
merely a paper blockade<a name="FNanchor522"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_522">[522]</a>. "We were not very sanguine of success,"
wrote Lyons, but Seward "had listened to him [Mercier] with
calmness," and personally seemed disinclined to issue the required
Proclamation. This despatch, making it appear that England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"></a>[V1:pg 250]</span> and
France were in close harmony and that Lyons and Mercier were having
a difficult time at Washington was printed, later, in the
Parliamentary Papers. It was received by Russell on August 5, and
in spite of the reassurances of Lyons' private letter (naturally
not for printing) presumably received in the same mail with the
official despatch, it furnished the basis of his "strong"
instruction of August 8.</p>
<p>At Washington also there were indications of an effort to
prepare a good case for the British public and Parliament. July 23,
so Lyons wrote privately, Seward had prevented the issue of the
"Southern Ports" Proclamation<a name="FNanchor523"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_523">[523]</a>, and on the next day he was shown by
Seward, confidentially, an instruction to Adams and other Ministers
abroad in which was maintained the right to close the ports by
proclamation, but stating the Government's decision not to exercise
the right. Lyons believed this was the end of the matter<a name=
"FNanchor524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524">[524]</a>. Yet on August
12, he presented himself formally at the Department of State and
stated that he had instructions to declare that "Her Majesty's
Government would consider a decree closing the ports of the South
actually in possession of the insurgent or Confederate States as
null and void, and that they would not submit to measures taken on
the high seas in pursuance of such decree."... "Mr. Seward thanked
me for the consideration I had shown; and begged me to confine
myself for the present to the verbal announcement I had just made.
He said it would be difficult for me to draw up a written
communication which would not have the air of a threat." To this
Lyons agreed<a name="FNanchor525"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_525">[525]</a>.</p>
<p>This permitted a warmth-creating impression to Englishmen of the
"forthright yet friendly" tone of British <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_251"></a>[V1:pg 251]</span> diplomats when
dealing with Seward. So also did Russell's instruction of August 8,
not yet received by Lyons when he took the stage at Washington. Yet
there is a possibility that Lyons was in fact merely playing his
part as Seward had asked him to play it. On the next day, August
13, he acknowledged the receipt of Russell's communication of July
24, in which it was stated that while Great Britain could not
acquiesce in the "Southern Ports" Bill <i>no final instructions</i>
would be sent until Lincoln issued a Proclamation. Lyons now
explained, "As Mr. Seward is undoubtedly at this moment opposed to
closing the Ports, I have thought it wiser to be guided by him for
the present as to the mode of communicating your decision about the
matter<a name="FNanchor526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526">[526]</a>."
Is it possible that Seward really wished to have a "strong," yet
not "too strong" statement from Lyons in order to combat the
advocates of the "Ports" Bill? There are many ramifications of
diplomatic policy--especially in a popular government. At any rate
on August 16 Lyons could assure Russell that there "was no question
now of issuing the Proclamation<a name="FNanchor527"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_527">[527]</a>." And on the nineteenth could write
officially that a Proclamation based on the Bill had indeed been
issued, but without the objectionable fourth section<a name=
"FNanchor528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528">[528]</a>.</p>
<p>The whole affair of the "Southern Ports" Bill occupies more
space in the British Parliamentary Papers, and excited more
attention from the British Government than it would seem to have
merited from the Washington attitude toward it. The Bill had been
drawn by the Secretary of the Treasury, and its other sections
related to methods of meeting a situation where former customs
houses and places for the collection of import duties were now in
the hands of the Confederacy. The fourth section alone <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_252"></a>[V1:pg 252]</span> implied a
purpose to declare a paper blockade. The idea of proclaiming closed
the Southern ports may have at first received the sanction of
Seward as consistent with his denial of the existence of a war; or
it may have been a part of his "high tone" foreign policy<a name=
"FNanchor529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529">[529]</a>, but the more
reasonable supposition is that the Bill was merely one of many
ill-considered measures put forth in the first months of the war by
the North in its spasm of energy seeking to use every and any
public means to attack the South. But the interest attached to the
measure in this work is the British attitude. There can be no doubt
that Russell, in presenting papers to Parliament was desirous of
making clear two points: first, the close harmony with
France--which in fact was not so close as was made to appear;
second, the care and vigour of the Foreign Secretary in guarding
British interests. Now in fact British trade was destined to be
badly hurt by the blockade, but as yet had not been greatly
hampered. Nor did Russell yet think an effective blockade feasible.
Writing to Lyons a week after his official protest on the "Southern
Ports" Bill, he expressed the opinion that a "<i>regular</i>
blockade" could not possibly prevent trade with the South:</p>
<blockquote>"If our ships can go in ballast for cotton to the
Southern Ports it will be well, but if this cannot be done by
agreement there will be surely, in the extent of 3,000 miles,
creeks and bays out of which small vessels may come, and run for
Jamaica or the Bahamas where the cargoes might be transhipped. But
it is not for Downing Street to suggest such plans to Cheapside and
Tooley Street<a name="FNanchor530"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_530">[530]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253"></a>[V1:pg 253]</span>
<p>A better knowledge of American geography would have made clear
to Russell that if but seven Southern ports were effectively
blockaded the remaining 2,550 miles of coast line would be useless
for the export of cotton in any considerable amount. His bays and
creeks did indeed long provide access to small vessels, but these
were not adequate for the transport of a bulky export like
cotton<a name="FNanchor531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531">[531]</a>.
To Russell, however, the blockade appearing negligible in probable
effect and also not open to objection by neutrals if regularly
established, it seemed that any immediate danger to British trade
was averted by the final American action on the "Southern Ports"
Bill. It was not until the blockade did begin to be thoroughly
effective that either the British public or Government gave it
serious consideration.</p>
<p>Not again until late November did Russell return with any
interest to the subject of the blockade and then it was again on an
American effort which seemed to indicate the ineffectiveness of
blockading squadrons and a plan to remedy this by unusual, even
"uncivilized," if not illegal, methods. This was the "Stone Boat
Fleet" plan of blocking Charleston harbour by sinking vessels
across the entrance bar<a name="FNanchor532"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_532">[532]</a>. The plan was reported by Lyons and the
news received in England at the most uncertain moment as to the
outcome of the <i>Trent</i> controversy<a name=
"FNanchor533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533">[533]</a>. British press
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254"></a>[V1:pg 254]</span>
Government at first placed no stress on it, presumably because of
the feeling that in view of the existing crisis it was a minor
matter. In the same week Lyons, having been asked by Russell for an
opinion on the blockade, answered:</p>
<blockquote>"I am a good deal puzzled as to how I ought to answer
your question whether I consider the Blockade effective. It is
certainly by no means strict or vigorous along the immense extent
of coast to which it is supposed to apply. I suppose the ships
which run it successfully both in and out are more numerous than
those which are intercepted. On the other hand it is very far from
being a mere Paper Blockade. A great many vessels are captured; it
is a most serious interruption to Trade; and if it were as
ineffective as Mr. Jefferson Davis says in his Message, he would
not be so very anxious to get rid of it<a name=
"FNanchor534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534">[534]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was a very fair description of the blockade situation.
Lyons, unaffected by irritations resulting from the <i>Trent</i>,
showed the frame of mind of a "determined neutral," as he was fond
of describing himself. His answer was the first given to Russell
indicating a possibility that the blockade might, after all, become
strictly effective and thus exceedingly harmful to British trade.
There is no direct <i>proof</i> that this influenced Russell to
denounce the plan of blocking Southern harbours with stone-laden
boats sunk in the channel, but the existence of such a motive seems
probable. Moreover his protest was not made until December 20, the
<i>day after</i> he had learned officially from Adams that Wilkes
was unauthorized in searching the <i>Trent</i>--a day on which
strain and uncertainty regarding American intentions were greatly
lessened. Russell then wrote to Lyons that he observed it to be
stated, "apparently on good authority," that the declared purpose
of the stone boat fleet was "of destroying these harbours for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"></a>[V1:pg 255]</span>
ever." He characterized this as implying "utter despair of the
restoration of the Union," and as being only "a measure of revenge
and irremediable injury against an enemy."</p>
<p>"But even in this view, as a scheme of embittered and sanguinary
war, such a measure is not justifiable. It is a plot against the
commerce of nations and the free intercourse of the Southern States
of America with the civilized world. It is a project worthy only of
times of barbarism."</p>
<p>Lyons was instructed to speak in this sense to Seward, who, it
was hoped, would disavow the project<a name=
"FNanchor535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535">[535]</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>There was nothing in Lyons' despatches, nor in the American
newspaper extracts accompanying them, to warrant such accusation
and expostulation. Lyons had merely commented that by some in
America the project had been characterized as "odious and
barbarous," adding, "The question seems to depend on the extent to
which the harbours will be permanently injured<a name=
"FNanchor536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536">[536]</a>." It will be
noted that Russell did not refer to information received from Lyons
(though it was already in hand), but to "apparently good authority"
in justification of his vigorous denunciation. But like vigour, and
like characterization of American "barbarism" did not appear in the
British press until after the news arrived of the release of Mason
and Slidell. Then the storm broke, well summed up in the Punch
cartoon entitled "Retrogression. (A Very Sad Picture.) War Dance of
the I.O.U. Indian," and showing Uncle Sam in war-feathers and with
war-club, in his hand a flag made of the <i>New York Herald</i>,
dancing in glee on the shores of a deserted harbour across which
stretched a row of sunken ships<a name="FNanchor537"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_537">[537]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256"></a>[V1:pg 256]</span>
<p>On January 13 the Liverpool Shipowners' Association called the
attention of the Foreign Office to the news that Charleston harbour
had been closed by stone boats and urged governmental
remonstrance<a name="FNanchor538"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_538">[538]</a>. Hammond at once replied quoting the
language of Russell's letter of December 20 and stating that
further representations would be made<a name=
"FNanchor539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539">[539]</a>. On the
sixteenth Russell again instructed Lyons to speak to Seward, but
now was much less rasping in language, arguing, rather, the injury
in the future to the United States itself in case the harbours were
permanently destroyed since "... the object of war is peace, and
the purposes of peace are mutual goodwill and advantageous
commercial intercourse<a name="FNanchor540"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_540">[540]</a>." To-day it seems absurd that any save
the most ignorant observer should have thought the North
contemplated a permanent and revengeful destruction of Southern
port facilities. Nor was there any just ground for such an extreme
British view of the Northern plan. Yet even Robert Browning was
affected by the popular outcry. "For what will you do," he wrote
Story, "if Charleston becomes loyal again<a name=
"FNanchor541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541">[541]</a>?" a query
expressive of the increasing English concern, even alarm, at the
intense bitterness, indicating a long war, of the American
belligerents. How absurd, not to say ridiculous, was this British
concern at an American "lapse toward barbarism" was soon made
evident. On January II Lyons, acting on the instructions of
December 20, brought up the matter with Seward and was promptly
assured that there was no plan whatever "to injure the harbours
permanently." Seward stated that there had never been any plan,
even, to sink boats in the main entrance channels, but merely the
lesser channels, because the Secretary of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_257"></a>[V1:pg 257]</span> the Navy had
reported that with the blockading fleet he could "stop up the
'large holes,'" but "could not stop up the 'small ones.'" Seward
assured Lyons that just as soon as the Union was restored all
obstructions would be removed, and he added that the best proof
that the entrance to Charleston harbour had not been destroyed was
the fact that in spite of blockading vessels and stone boats "a
British steamer laden with contraband of war had just succeeded in
getting in<a name="FNanchor542"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_542">[542]</a>." Again, on February 10, this time
following Russell's instruction of January 16, Lyons approached
Seward and was told that he might inform Russell that "all the
vessels laden with stone, which had been prepared for obstructing
the harbours, had been already sunk, and that it is not likely that
any others will be used for that purpose<a name=
"FNanchor543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543">[543]</a>." This was no
yielding to Great Britain, nor even an answer to Russell's
accusation of barbarity. The fact was that the plan of obstruction
of harbours, extending even to placing a complete barrier, had been
undertaken by the Navy with little expectation of success, and, on
the first appearance of new channels made by the wash of waters,
was soon abandoned<a name="FNanchor544"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_544">[544]</a>.</p>
<p>The British outcry, Russell's assumption in protest that America
was conducting war with barbarity, and the protest itself, may seem
at first glance to have been merely manifestations of a British
tendency to meddle, as a "superior nation" in the affairs of other
states and to give unasked-for advice. A hectoring of peoples whose
civilization was presumably less advanced than that which stamped
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258"></a>[V1:pg 258]</span>
Englishman was, according to Matthew Arnold, traditional--was a
characteristic of British public and Government alike<a name=
"FNanchor545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545">[545]</a>. But this is
scarcely a satisfactory explanation in the present case. For in the
first place it is to be remarked that the sinking of obstructions
in an enemy's harbours in order to render more effective a blockade
was no novelty in maritime warfare, as Russell must have well
known, and that there was no modern record of such obstructions
having permanently destroyed a harbour. A far more reasonable
explanation is that which connects the energy of the British
Government in opposing a proposed American closing of Southern
harbours by Presidential proclamation, with a like energy against
the stone boat project. The first method was indeed rightly
regarded as a violation of accustomed maritime belligerency, but
both methods were primarily objectionable in British eyes because
they were very evidently the result of efforts to find a way in
which an as yet ineffective blockade could be made more rigorous.
On the impossibility of an effective blockade, if conducted on
customary lines, the British people and Foreign Secretary had
pinned their faith that there would be no serious interruption of
trade. This was still the view in January, 1862, though doubts were
arising, and the "stone boat" protest must be regarded as another
evidence of watchful guardianship of commerce with the South. The
very thought that the blockade might become effective, in which
case all precedent would demand respect for it, possibly caused
Russell to use a tone not customary with him in upbraiding the
North for a planned "barbarity."</p>
<p>Within three months the blockade and its effectiveness was to be
made the subject of the first serious parliamentary discussion on
the Civil War in America. In another three months the Government
began to feel a pressure from its associate in "joint attitude,"
France, to examine again <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_259"></a>[V1:pg 259]</span> with much care its asserted
policy of strict neutrality, and this because of the increased
effectiveness of the blockade. Meanwhile another "American
question" was serving to cool somewhat British eagerness to go hand
in hand with France. For nearly forty years since independence from
Spain the Mexican Republic had offered a thorny problem to European
nations since it was difficult, in the face of the American Monroe
Doctrine, to put sufficient pressure upon her for the satisfaction
of the just claims of foreign creditors. In 1860 measures were
being prepared by France, Great Britain and Spain to act jointly in
the matter of Mexican debts. Commenting on these measures,
President Buchanan in his annual message to Congress of December 3,
1860, had sounded a note of warning to Europe indicating that
American principles would compel the use of force in aid of Mexico
if debt-collecting efforts were made the excuse for a plan "to
deprive our neighbouring Republic of portions of her territory."
But this was at the moment of the break-up of the Union and
attracted little attention in the United States. For the same
reason, no longer fearing an American block to these plans, the
three European Governments, after their invitation to the United
States to join them had been refused, signed a convention, October
31, 1861, to force a payment of debts by Mexico. They pledged
themselves, however, to seek no accession of territory and not to
interfere in the internal affairs of Mexico.</p>
<p>In this pledge Great Britain and Spain were sincere. Napoleon
III was not--was indeed pursuing a policy not at first understood
even by his Ministers<a name="FNanchor546"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_546">[546]</a>. A joint expedition under the leadership
of the Spanish General Prim was despatched, and once in Mexico took
possession of customs houses and began to collect duties. It soon
became evident <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260"></a>[V1:pg
260]</span> to the British and Spanish agents on the spot that
France had far other objects than the mere satisfaction of debts.
The result was a clash of interests, followed by separate
agreements with Mexico and the withdrawal of forces by Great
Britain and Spain. This difference of view on Mexican policy had
become clear to Cowley, British Ambassador at Paris, by January,
1862, and from that month until the end of March his private
letters to Russell referring to American affairs in general are
almost wholly concerned with French designs on Mexico. Cowley
learned that earlier rumours of Napoleon's purpose to place the
Archduke Maximilian of Austria upon the <i>Throne</i> of Mexico,
far from being unfounded, were but faint indications of a great
French "colonial Empire" scheme, and he thought that there was
"some ill-will to the United States at the bottom of all
this<a name="FNanchor547"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_547">[547]</a>...." He feared that the Mexican question
would "give us a deal of trouble yet<a name=
"FNanchor548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548">[548]</a>," and by March
was writing of the "monstrous claims on the Mexican Govt." made by
France<a name="FNanchor549"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_549">[549]</a>.</p>
<p>These reactions of Cowley were fully shared by Russell, and he
hastened, in March, to withdraw British forces in Mexico, as also
did Spain. Great Britain believed that she had been tricked into a
false position in Mexico, hastened to escape from it, but in view
of the close relation of joint policy with France toward the Civil
War in America, undertook no direct opposition though prophesying
an evil result. This situation required France to refrain, for a
time, from criticism of British policy and action toward the
North--to pursue, in brief, a "follow on" policy, rather than one
based on its own initiative. On the British side <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_261"></a>[V1:pg 261]</span> the French
Mexican policy created a suspicion of Napoleon's hidden purposes
and objects in the Civil War and made the British Government slow
to accept French suggestions. The result was that in relation to
that war Great Britain set the pace and France had to keep step--a
very advantageous situation for the North, as the event was to
prove. On the purely Mexican question Lyons early took opportunity
to assure Seward that Great Britain was "entirely averse to any
interference in the internal affairs of Mexico, and that nothing
could be further from their wishes than to impose upon the Mexican
Nation any Government not of its own choice<a name=
"FNanchor550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550">[550]</a>."</p>
<p>British dislike of France's Mexican venture served to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"></a>[V1:pg 262]</span>
swell the breeze of amity toward America that had sprung up once
the <i>Trent</i> was beyond the horizon, and made, temporarily, for
smooth sailing in the relations of Great Britain and the North.
Lyons wrote on February 7 that the "present notion appears to be to
overwhelm us with demonstrations of friendship and
confidence<a name="FNanchor551"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_551">[551]</a>." Adams' son in London thought "our work
here is past its crisis," and that, "Our victory is won on this
side the water<a name="FNanchor552"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_552">[552]</a>," while the American Minister himself
believed that "the prospect of interference with us is growing more
and more remote<a name="FNanchor553"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_553">[553]</a>." Russell also was optimistic, writing to
Lyons, "Our relations have now got into a very smooth groove....
There is no longer any excitement here upon the question of
America. I fear Europe is going to supplant the affairs of America
as an exciting topic<a name="FNanchor554"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_554">[554]</a>," meaning, presumably, disturbances
arising in Italy. On April 4 Adams described his diplomatic duties
as "almost in a state of profound calm<a name=
"FNanchor555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555">[555]</a>."</p>
<p>This quiet in relation to America is evidence that no matter
what anxiety was felt by British statesmen over the effects of the
blockade there was as yet no inclination seriously to question its
legality. That there was, nevertheless, real anxiety is shown by an
urgent letter from Westbury to Palmerston upon the blockade,
asserting that if cotton brought but four pence at Charleston and
thirteen pence at Liverpool there must be some truth in its alleged
effectiveness:</p>
<blockquote>"I am greatly opposed to any violent interference. Do
not let us give the Federal States any pretence for saying that
they failed thro' our interference.... Patience for <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_263"></a>[V1:pg 263]</span> a few more
weeks is I am satisfied the wiser and the more expedient
policy<a name="FNanchor556"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_556">[556]</a>."</blockquote>

<i>Reproduced by permission of the Proprietors of "Punch"</i></p>
<br>
<p>This would indicate some Cabinet discussion, at least, on the
blockade and on British trade interests. But Westbury's "few more
weeks" had no place in Russell's thought, for on February 15 he
wrote to Lyons in regard to assertions being made that the blockade
was ineffective because certain vessels had eluded it:</p>
<blockquote>"Her Majesty's Government, however, are of opinion
that, assuming that the blockade is duly notified, and also that a
number of ships is stationed and remains at the entrance of a port,
sufficient really to prevent access to it or to create an evident
danger of entering or leaving it, and that these ships do not
voluntarily permit ingress or egress, the fact that various ships
may have successfully escaped through it (as in the particular
instances here referred to) will not of itself prevent the blockade
from being an effective one by international law<a name=
"FNanchor557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557">[557]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>From this view Russell never departed in official
instructions<a name="FNanchor558"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_558">[558]</a>. England's position as the leading
maritime Power made it inevitable that she should promptly approve
the Northern blockade effort and be cautious in criticizing its
legitimate operation. Both her own history and probable future
interests when a belligerent, required such a policy far more
important in the eyes of statesmen than any temporary injury to
British commerce. English merchants, if determined to trade with
the South, must take their own risks, and that Russell believed
they would do so is evidenced by his comment to Adams that it was a
tradition of the sea that Englishmen "would, if money were to be
made by it, send supplies even to hell at the risk of burning their
sails."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264"></a>[V1:pg 264]</span>
<p>But trade problems with the South soon brought real pressure on
the Government. In January, while marking time until Mason should
arrive at his post, the Confederate commissioners already in London
very nearly took a step that might have prejudiced the new envoy's
position. They had now learned through public documents that
Russell had informed Adams he "had no intention of seeing them
again." Very angry they planned a formal protest to the British
Government, but in the end Mann and Rost counselled silence,
outvoting Yancey<a name="FNanchor559"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_559">[559]</a>. On his arrival Mason ignored this
situation and with cause for, warmly received socially in
pro-Southern circles, he felt confident that at least a private
reception would soon be given him by Russell. He became, indeed,
somewhat of a social lion, and mistaking this personal popularity
for evidence of parliamentary, if not governmental, attitude, was
confident of quick advantages for the South. On the day after his
arrival he wrote unofficially to Hunter, Confederate Secretary of
State "... although the Ministry may hang back in regard to the
blockade and recognition through the Queen's speech, at the opening
of Parliament next week the popular voice through the House of
Commons will demand both."... "I shall be disappointed if the
Parliament does not insist on definite action by the
Ministry<a name="FNanchor560"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_560">[560]</a>...."</p>
<p>Carefully considering the situation and taking the advice of
many English friends, Mason and Slidell agreed that the best line
to take was to lay aside for the moment the claim to recognition
and to urge European repudiation of the blockade. Slidell, arrived
in Paris, wrote Mason that in his coming interview with Thouvenel
he should "make only a passing allusion to the question of
recognition, intimating that on that point I am not disposed at
present <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265"></a>[V1:pg
265]</span> to press consideration. But I shall insist upon the
inefficiency of the blockade, the 'vandalism of the stone fleet,'
etc<a name="FNanchor561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561">[561]</a>."
Mason was urged to take a like course with Russell. Both men were
much excited by a document a copy of which had been secured by Mann
purporting to be a "confidential memorandum" addressed by England
to the Continental Powers, asking whether the time had not come to
raise the blockade. No such memorandum existed, but Slidell and
Mason believed it genuine<a name="FNanchor562"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_562">[562]</a>. They had great hopes of the opening of
Parliament, but when that event took place, February 6, and the
only references in debate were to the <i>Trent</i> and its
fortunate outcome, Mason was puzzled and chagrined. He wrote: "It
is thought that silence as to the blockade was intended to leave
that question open<a name="FNanchor563"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_563">[563]</a>." This, no doubt, was the consolatory
explanation of his friends, but the unofficial interview with
Russell, at his home, on February 10, chilled Mason's hopes.</p>
<p>As agreed with Slidell, emphasis in this interview was laid by
Mason on the blockade, though recognition was asked. His report to
Richmond shows that he proceeded with great caution, omitting
portions of his instructions on cotton for fear of arousing
antagonism, and venturing only a slight departure by expressing the
hope that if Great Britain wished to renew communication with the
Confederacy it might be made through him, rather than through the
British consuls at the South. Russell's "only reply was, he hoped I
might find my residence in London agreeable." He refused to see
Mason's credentials, stating this to be "unnecessary, our relations
being unofficial." He listened with courtesy, asked a few
questions, but "seemed utterly <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_266"></a>[V1:pg 266]</span> disinclined to enter into
conversation at all as to the policy of his Government, and only
said, in substance, they must await events." Certainly it was a
cool reception, and Mason departed with the conviction that
Russell's "personal sympathies were not with us, and his policy
inaction<a name="FNanchor564"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_564">[564]</a>." But Mason still counted on
parliamentary pressure on the Government, and he was further
encouraged in this view by a letter from Spence, at Liverpool,
stating that he had just received a request to come to London "from
a government quarter, of all the <i>most important</i><a name=
"FNanchor565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565">[565]</a>."</p>
<p>The summons of Spence to London shows that the Government itself
feared somewhat a pro-Southern move in Parliament. He reported to
Mason that interviews had taken place with Palmerston and with
Russell, that he had unfortunately missed one with Gladstone, and,
while not citing these men directly, declared the general "London
idea" to be that of "postponement"; since it was inevitable that
"the North will break down in a few months on the score of money,"
and that "We have only to wait three months." Evidently Spence
believed he was being used as an intermediary and influential
adviser in pro-Southern circles to persuade them to a period of
quiet. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267"></a>[V1:pg
267]</span> This, he thought, was unwise since delay would be
injurious<a name="FNanchor566"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_566">[566]</a>. Of like opinion were the two Members of
Parliament who were, throughout Mason's career in England, to be
his closest advisers. These were Gregory and Lindsay, the former
possessing somewhat of a following in the "gentleman-ruler" class,
the latter the largest shipowner in Great Britain. Their advice
also was to press on the blockade question<a name=
"FNanchor567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567">[567]</a>, as a matter of
primary British commercial interest, and they believed that France
was eager to follow a British lead. This was contrary to Slidell's
notion at the moment, but of this Mason was unaware<a name=
"FNanchor568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568">[568]</a>.</p>
<p>The Government did indeed feel compelled to lay before
Parliament the papers on the blockade. This was a bulky document of
one hundred and twenty-six pages and covered the period from May 3,
1861, to February 17, 1862. In it were the details of the
institution of the blockade, reports from British consuls on its
effectiveness, lists of vessels captured and of vessels evading it,
all together furnishing a very complete view of this, the principal
maritime belligerent effort of the North<a name=
"FNanchor569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569">[569]</a>. The Blockade
Papers gave opportunity for debate, if desired, and especially so
as almost at the end of this document appeared that instruction of
February 15 by Russell to Lyons, which clearly stated British
acceptance of the blockade as effective. Mason's interview with
Russell occurred on the tenth. Five days later, after Spence had
been urged vainly to use his influence for "postponement," Russell,
so it must appear, gave challenge to pro-Southern sentiment by
asserting the effectiveness of the blockade, a challenge almost
immediately made known to Parliament by the presentation of
papers.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268"></a>[V1:pg 268]</span>
<p>Unless Southern sympathizers were meekly to acquiesce, without
further protest, in governmental policy they must now make some
decided effort. This came in the shape of a debate in the Commons,
on March 7, of a motion by Gregory urging the Government to declare
the blockade ineffective<a name="FNanchor570"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_570">[570]</a>, and of a similar debate on March 10 in
the Lords. As is inevitable where many speakers participate in a
debate the arguments advanced were repeated and reiterated. In the
Commons important speeches for the motion were made by Gregory,
Bentinck, Sir James Ferguson, Lord Robert Cecil and Lindsay, while
against it appeared Forster and Monckton Milnes. The
Solicitor-General, Roundell Palmer, presented the Government view.
Gregory opened the debate by seeking to make clear that while
himself favourable to recognition of the South the present motion
had no essential bearing on that question and was directed wholly
to a <i>fact</i>--that the blockade was not in reality effective
and should not be recognized as such. He presented and analysed
statistics to prove the frequency with which vessels passed through
the blockade, using the summaries given by Mason to Russell in
their interview of February 10, which were now before Parliament in
the document on the blockade just presented, and he cited the
reports of Bunch at Charleston as further evidence. This was the
burden of Gregory's argument<a name="FNanchor571"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_571">[571]</a>, but he glanced in passing at many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269"></a>[V1:pg 269]</span>
other points favourable to the South, commenting on its free trade
principles, depicting the "Stone Fleet" as a barbarity, asserting
the right of the South to secede, declaring that France regarded
British attitude as determined by a selfish policy looking to
future wars, and attacking Seward on the ground of American
inconsistency, falsely paraphrasing him as stating that "as for all
those principles of international law, which we have ever upheld,
they are as but dust in the balance compared with the exigencies of
the moment<a name="FNanchor572"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_572">[572]</a>." Gregory concluded with the statement
that the United States should be treated "with justice and nothing
more."</p>
<p>When presenting a cause in Parliament its advocates should agree
on a line of argument. The whole theory of this movement on the
blockade was that it was wise to minimize the question of
recognition, and Gregory had laboured to prove that this was not
related to a refusal longer to recognize the blockade. But
Bentinck, the second speaker for the motion, promptly undid him for
he unhappily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270"></a>[V1:pg
270]</span> admitted that recognition and blockade questions were
so closely interwoven that they could not be considered separately.
This was promptly seized upon by Forster, who led in opposition.
Forster's main argument, however, was a very able tearing to pieces
of Gregory's figures, showing that nearly all the alleged blockade
runners were in reality merely small coasting steamers, which, by
use of shallow inner channels, could creep along the shore and then
make a dash for the West Indies. The effectiveness of the blockade
of main ports for ocean-going vessels carrying bulky cargoes was
proved, he declared, by the price of raw cotton in England, where
it was 100 per cent. greater than in the South, and of salt in
Charleston, where the importer could make a profit of 1,000 per
cent. To raise the blockade, he argued, would be a direct violation
by Britain of her neutrality. The real reason for this motion was
not the <i>ineffectiveness</i> of the blockade, but the
effectiveness, and the real object an English object, not a
Southern one. Gregory was taunted for changing a motion to
recognize the Confederacy into the present one because he knew the
former would fail while the present motion was deceitfully intended
to secure the same end. Forster strongly approved the conduct of
the Government in preserving strict neutrality, alleging that any
other conduct would have meant "a war in which she [England] would
have had to fight for slavery against her kinsmen."</p>
<p>Gregory's speech was cautious and attempted to preserve a
judicial tone of argument on fact. Forster's reads like that of one
who knows his cause already won. Gregory's had no fire in it and
was characterized by Henry Adams, an interested auditor, as
"listened to as you would listen to a funeral eulogy."... "The
blockade is now universally acknowledged to be
unobjectionable<a name="FNanchor573"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_573">[573]</a>." This estimate is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_271"></a>[V1:pg 271]</span> borne out by
the speech for the Government by the Solicitor-General, who
maintained the effectiveness of the blockade and who answered
Gregory's argument that recognition was not in question by stating
that to refuse longer to recognize the blockade would result in a
situation of "armed neutrality"--that is of "unproclaimed war." He
pictured the disgust of Europe if England should enter upon such a
war in alliance "with a country ... which is still one of the last
strongholds of slavery"--an admission made in the fervour of debate
that was dangerous as tending to tie the Government's hands in the
future, but which was, no doubt, merely a personal and carelessly
ventured view, not a governmentally authorized one. In general the
most interesting feature of this debate is the hearty approval
given by friends of the North to the Government's entire line of
policy and conduct in relation to America. Their play at the
moment, feeling insecure as to the fixity of governmental policy,
was to approve heartily the neutrality now existing, and to make no
criticisms. Later, when more confident of the permanency of British
neutrality, they in turn became critics on the score of failure, in
specific cases, in neutral duty.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General's speech showed that there was no hope for
the motion unless it could be made a party question. Of that there
was no indication, and the motion was withdrawn. Three days later a
similar debate in the Lords was of importance only as offering
Russell, since he was now a member of the upper chamber, an
opportunity to speak for himself. Lord Campbell had disavowed any
intention to attack the blockade since Russell, on February 15, had
officially approved it, but criticized the sending to Lyons of the
despatch itself. Russell upheld the strict legality and
effectiveness of the blockade, stated that if England sided with
the South in any way the North would appeal to a slave
insurrection--the first reference to an idea <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_272"></a>[V1:pg 272]</span> which was to
play a very important r&ocirc;le with Russell and others later--and
concluded by expressing the opinion that three months would see the
end of the struggle on lines of separation, but with some form of
union between the two sovereignties<a name=
"FNanchor574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574">[574]</a>. Russell's
speech was an unneeded but emphatic negative of the pro-Southern
effort.</p>
<p>Clearly Southern sympathizers had committed an error in tactics
by pressing for a change of British policy. The rosy hopes of Mason
were dashed and the effect of the efforts of his friends was to
force the Government to a decided stand when they preferred, as the
summons of Spence to conference makes evident, to leave in abeyance
for a time any further declaration on the blockade. The refusal of
Mason and his Southern friends to wait compelled a governmental
decision and the result was Russell's instruction to Lyons of
February 15. The effect of the debate on Mason was not to cause
distrust of his English advisers, but to convince him that the
existing Government was more determined in unfriendliness than he
had supposed. Of the blockade he wrote: "... no step will be taken
by this Government to interfere with it<a name=
"FNanchor575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575">[575]</a>." He thought
the military news from America in part responsible as: "The late
reverses at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson have had an unfortunate
effect upon the minds of our friends <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_273"></a>[V1:pg 273]</span> here<a name=
"FNanchor576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576">[576]</a>...." Spence was
opposed to any further move in Parliament until some more definite
push on the Government from France should occur<a name=
"FNanchor577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577">[577]</a>. Slidell,
anxiously watching from Paris the effort in England, had now
altered his view of policy and was convinced there was no hope in
France until England gave the signal. Referring to his previous
idea that the Continent could be put in opposition to Great Britain
on the blockade he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"I then supposed that the influence of the Emperor was
such that any view of the question which he might urge on the
British Cabinet would be adopted. I have since had reason to change
entirely this opinion. I am now satisfied that in all that concerns
us the initiative must be taken by England; that the Emperor sets
such value on her good will that he will make any sacrifice of his
own opinions and policy to retain it<a name=
"FNanchor578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578">[578]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On March 28 he repeated this conviction to Mason<a name=
"FNanchor579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579">[579]</a>. It was a
correct judgment. Mason was thereby exalted with the knowledge that
his was to be the first place in importance in any and all
operations intended to secure European support for the Confederacy,
but he could not conceal from himself that the first steps
undertaken in that direction had been premature. From this first
failure dated his fixed belief, no matter what hopes were sometimes
expressed later, that only a change of Government in England would
help the Southern cause.</p>

smuggling over 3,000 miles of coast and 1,500 miles of land
frontier seems to me impossible" (<i>Ibid.</i>, Aug. 17, 1861).
Russell had received some two weeks earlier, a letter from Bunch at
Charleston, urging that England make no objection to the blockade
in order that the South might be taught the lesson that "King
Cotton," was not, after all, powerful enough to compel British
recognition and support. He stated that Southerners, angry at the
failure to secure recognition, were loudly proclaiming that they
both could and would humble and embarrass Great Britain (F.O., Am.,
Vol. 781. No. 82. Bunch to Russell, July 8, 1861). Bunch wrote on
July 23 that the South planned to hold back its cotton until Great
Britain and France raised the blockade (<i>Ibid.</i>, No. 87).
Bunch was now impressed with Southern determination.</blockquote>

Russell, Feb. 28, 1862. The fact that Slidell arrived in France
just as Napoleon's plans for Mexico took clearer form has been made
the ground for assumptions that he immediately gave assurance of
Southern acquiescence and encouraged Napoleon to go forward. I have
found no good evidence of this--rather the contrary. The whole plan
was clear to Cowley by mid-January before Slidell reached Paris,
and Slidell's own correspondence shows no early push on Mexico. The
Confederate agents' correspondence, both official and private, will
be much used later in this work and here requires explanation. But
four historical works of importance deal with it extensively, (1)
Richardson, <i>Messages and Papers of the Confederacy</i>, 2 vols.,
1905, purports to include the despatches of Mason and Slidell to
Richmond, but is very unsatisfactory. Important despatches are
missing, and elisions sometimes occur without indication. (2)
Virginia Mason, <i>The Public Life and Diplomatic Correspondence of
James M. Mason</i>, 1906, contains most of Mason's despatches,
including some not given by Richardson. The author also used the
<i>Mason Papers</i> (see below). (3) Callahan, <i>The Diplomatic
History of the Southern Confederacy</i>, 1901, is the most complete
and authoritative work on Southern diplomacy yet published. He used
the collection known as the "Pickett Papers," for official
despatches, supplementing these when gaps occurred by a study of
the <i>Mason Papers</i>, but his work, narrative in form, permits
no extended printing of documents. (4) L.M. Sears, <i>A Confederate
Diplomat at the Court of Napoleon III</i>. (Am. Hist. Rev. Jan.,
1921), is a study drawn from Slidell's private letters in the
<i>Mason Papers</i>. The Mason Papers exist in eight folios or
packages in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, and
in addition there is one bound volume of Mason's despatches to
Richmond. These contain the private correspondence of Mason and
Slidell while in Europe. Slidell's letters are originals. Mason's
letters are copies in Slidell's hand-writing, made apparently at
Mason's request and sent to him in May, 1865. A complete typed copy
of this correspondence was taken by me in 1913, but this has not
hitherto been used save in a manuscript Master's degree thesis by
Walter M. Case, "James M. Mason, Confederate Diplomat," Stanford
University, 1915, and for a few citations by C.F. Adams, <i>A
Crisis in Downing Street</i> (Mass. Hist. Soc. <i>Proceedings</i>,
May, 1914). The Mason Papers also contain many letters from Mason's
English friends, Spence, Lindsay, Gregory and others.</blockquote>

Cotton Exchange. He made a strong impression on Mason, was early
active in planning and administering Southern cotton loans in
England, and was in constant touch with Mason. By Slidell he was
much less favourably regarded and the impression created by his
frequent letters to Mason is that of a man of second-rate calibre
elated by the prominent part he seemed to be playing in what he
took to be the birth of a new State.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_571"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor571">[571]</a> Mason's authenticated statistics,
unfortunately for his cause, only came down to Oct. 31, 1861, a
fact which might imply that after that date the blockade was
rapidly becoming effective and which certainly did indicate that it
was at least sufficiently effective to prevent regular and frequent
communications between the government at Richmond and its agents
abroad. Did Russell have this in mind when he promptly incorporated
Mason's figures in the papers presented to Parliament? These
figures showed that according to reports from four Southern ports,
sixty vessels had entered and cleared between April 29 and October
31, 1861; unauthenticated statistics extending to the date December
31, presented by Mason of vessels arrived at and departing from
Cuban ports showed forty-eight vessels, each way engaged in
blockade running. Seven of these were listed as "captured." Those
reaching Cuba were described as twenty-six British, 14 Confederate,
3 Spanish, 3 American and 2 Mexican, but in none of these
statistics were the names of the vessels given, for obvious
reasons, in the printed paper though apparently included in the
list submitted by Mason. These figures did in fact but reveal a
situation existing even after 1861. The American blockading fleets
had to be created from all sorts of available material and were
slow in getting under way. Regular ships of the old Navy could not
enforce it being too few in number, and also, at first, directing
their efforts to the capture of shore positions which would render
a large blockading squadron unnecessary. This proved an abortive
effort and it was not until 1862 that the development of a large
fleet of blockaders was seriously undertaken. (See <i>Fox, Confid.
Corresp.</i>, I, pp. 110, 115, 119 and especially 122, which, May
31, 1862, pays tribute to the energy with which the South for
"thirteen long months" had defended its important port shore
lines.) If Gregory had been able to quote a report by Bunch from
Charleston of April 5, 1862, he would have had a strong argument.
"The blockade runners are doing a great business.... Everything is
brought in in abundance. Not a day passes without an arrival or a
departure. The Richmond Government sent about a month ago an order
to Nassau for Medicines, Quinine, etc. It went from Nassau to New
York, was executed there, came back to Nassau, thence here, and was
on its way to Richmond in 21 days from the date of the order.
Nearly all the trade is under the British flag. The vessels are all
changed in Nassau and Havana. Passengers come and go freely and no
one seems to think that there is the slightest risk--which, indeed,
there is not." (Lyons Papers. Bunch to Lyons, April 5,
1862).</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_572"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor572">[572]</a> I have nowhere found any such statement by
Seward. Gregory's reference is to a note from Seward to Lyons of
May 27, 1861, printed in the Blockade Papers. This merely holds
that temporary absence of blockading ships does not impair the
blockade nor render "necessary a new notice of its
existence."</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_574"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor574">[574]</a> This "three months" statement returned to
plague Russell later, British merchants complaining that upon it
they had based plans in the belief that the Government had
something definite in view. Spence's reference to this "three
months" idea, after his conferences in London, would indicate that
Russell was merely indulging in a generalization due to the
expected financial collapse of the North. The Russian Ambassador in
London gave a different interpretation. He wrote that the Northern
victories in the West had caused Great Britain to think the time
near when the "border states," now tied to the Union by these
victories, would lead in a pacification on lines of separation from
the Southern slave states. "It is in this sense, and no other that
Russell's 'three months' speech in the Lords is to be taken."
(Brunow to F.O., March 3-15, 1862. No. 33). Brunow does not so
state, but his despatch sounds as if this were the result of a talk
with Russell. If so, it would indicate an attempt to interpret
Lincoln's "border state policy" in a sense that would appear
reasonable in the British view that there could be no real hope at
Washington of restoring the Union.</blockquote>

<h3>ENTER MR. LINDSAY</h3>
<br>
<p>The friendly atmosphere created by the lifting of the
threatening <i>Trent</i> episode, appears to have made Secretary
Seward believe that the moment was opportune for a renewal of
pressure on Great Britain and France for the recall of their
Proclamations of Neutrality. Seizing upon the victories of Grant at
Forts Henry and Donelson, he wrote to Adams on February 28
explaining that as a result the United States, now having access to
the interior districts of Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas, "had
determined to permit the restoration of trade upon our inland ways
and waters" under certain limitations, and that if this experiment
succeeded similar measures would be applied "to the country on the
sea-coast, which would be some alleviation of the rigour of the
blockade." He added that these "concessions" to foreign nations
would "go much further and faster" if those nations would withdraw
their "belligerent privileges heretofore so unnecessarily conceded,
as we conceive, to the insurgents<a name="FNanchor580"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_580">[580]</a>." This was large talk for a relatively
unchanged military situation. Grant had as yet but forced open the
door in the West and was still far from having "access to the
interior districts" of the states named. Lyons, being shown a copy
of this despatch to Adams, commented to Russell that while it might
be said the position and the spirit of the Northern armies were
greatly improved and notable successes probable, it could not be
maintained that hostilities were "so near <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_275"></a>[V1:pg 275]</span> their
conclusion or are carried on upon so small a scale as to disqualify
either party for the title of Belligerents<a name=
"FNanchor581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581">[581]</a>." Lyons and
Mercier were agreed that this was no time for the withdrawal of
belligerent rights to the South, and when the hint was received
that the purpose of making such a request was in Seward's mind, the
news quite took Thouvenel's breath away<a name=
"FNanchor582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582">[582]</a>. As yet,
however, Seward did no more than hint and Adams was quick to advise
that the moment had not yet come "when such a proceeding might seem
to me likely to be of use<a name="FNanchor583"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_583">[583]</a>."</p>
<p>Just at this time Seward was engaged in forwarding a measure no
doubt intended to secure British anti-slavery sympathy for the
North, yet also truly indicative of a Northern temper toward the
South and its "domestic institution." This was the negotiation of a
Slave-Trade treaty with Great Britain, by which America joined, at
last, the nations agreeing to unite their efforts in suppression of
the African Slave Trade. The treaty was signed by Seward and Lyons
at Washington on April 7. On the next day Seward wrote to Adams
that had such a treaty been ratified "in 1808, there would now have
been no sedition here, and no disagreement between the United
States and foreign nations<a name="FNanchor584"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_584">[584]</a>," a melancholy reflection intended to
suggest that the South alone had been responsible for the long
delay of American participation in a world humanitarian movement.
But the real purpose of the treaty, Lyons thought, was "to save the
credit of the President with the Party which elected him if he
should make concessions to the South, with a view of reconstructing
the Union<a name="FNanchor585"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_585">[585]</a>"--an erroneous view evincing a
misconception of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_276"></a>[V1:pg 276]</span> the intensity of both Northern
and Southern feeling if regarded from our present knowledge, but a
view natural enough to the foreign observer at the moment. Lyons,
in this letter, correctly stated the rising determination of the
North to restore the Union, but underestimated the rapid growth of
an equal determination against a restoration with slavery. The real
motive for Seward's eagerness to sign the Slave Trade treaty was
the thought of its influence on foreign, not domestic, affairs.
Lyons, being confident that Russell would approve, had taken "the
risk of going a little faster" than his instructions had
indicated<a name="FNanchor586"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_586">[586]</a>.</p>
<p>In this same letter Lyons dwelt upon the Northern elation over
recent military successes. The campaign in the West had been
followed in the East by a great effort under McClellan to advance
on Richmond up the peninsula of the James river and using
Chesapeake Bay as a means of water transportation and supply. This
campaign had been threatened by the appearance of the iron-clad ram
<i>Merrimac</i> and her attack on the wooden naval vessels
operating in support of McClellan, but on March 9 the
<i>Monitor</i>, a slow-moving floating iron-clad fortress, drove
the <i>Merrimac</i> from her helpless prey, and removed the
Southern threat to McClellan's communications. More than any other
one battle of the Civil War the duel between the <i>Merrimac</i>
and the <i>Monitor</i> struck the imagination of the British
people, and justly so because of its significance in relation to
the power of the British Navy. It "has been the main talk of the
town," wrote Adams, "ever since the news came, in Parliament, in
the clubs, in the city, among the military and naval people. The
impression is that it dates the commencement of a new era in
warfare, and that Great Britain must consent to begin over
again<a name="FNanchor587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587">[587]</a>."
The victory of the <i>Monitor</i> was relatively unimportant in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"></a>[V1:pg 277]</span>
British eyes, but a fight between two completely armoured ships,
and especially the ease with which the <i>Merrimac</i> had
vanquished wooden ships on the day previous, were cause of anxious
consideration for the future. Russell was more concerned over the
immediate lessons of the battle. "Only think," he wrote, "of our
position if in case of the Yankees turning upon us they should by
means of iron ships renew the triumphs they achieved in 1812-13 by
means of superior size and weight of metal<a name=
"FNanchor588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588">[588]</a>."</p>
<p>This, however, was but early and hasty speculation, and while
American ingenuity and experiment in naval warfare had, indeed,
sounded the death-knell of wooden ships of war, no great change in
the character of navies was immediately possible. Moreover British
shipbuilders could surely keep pace in iron-clad construction with
America or any other nation. The success of the <i>Monitor</i> was
soon regarded by the British Government as important mainly as
indicative of a new energy in the North promising further and more
important successes on land. The Government hoped for such Northern
success not because of any belief that these would go to the extent
of forcing the South into submission, for they were still, and for
a long time to come, obsessed with the conviction that Southern
independence must ultimately be achieved. The idea was, rather,
that the North, having vindicated its fighting ability and
realizing that the South, even though losing battle after battle,
was stubborn in the will to independence, would reach the
conclusion that the game was not worth the price and would consent
to separation. Russell wrote in this vein to Lyons, even though he
thought that the "morale of the Southern army seems to be ruined
for the time<a name="FNanchor589"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_589">[589]</a>." He believed that the end of the war
would be hastened by Northern victories, and he therefore rejoiced
in them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278"></a>[V1:pg 278]</span>
<p>Of somewhat like opinion up to the end of March, 1862, Lyons, in
April, began to doubt his previous analysis of Northern temper and
to write warnings that the end was not near. Grant's hard-won
victory in the West at Shiloh, April 6-7, the first great pitched
battle of the war, called out such a flood of Northern expressions
of determination to drive the war to the bitter end as to startle
Lyons and cause him, in a remarkably clear letter of survey, to
recast his opinions. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"The general opinion is that the Campaign of this
Spring will clear up most of the doubts as to the result of the
War. If the Military successes of the North continue, the
determination of the South, will (it is asserted) be at last really
put to the test. If notwithstanding great Military reverses, the
loss of the Border States, and the occupation of the most important
points on the Coast, the Southern men hold out, if they destroy as
they threaten to do, their cotton, tobacco and all other property
which cannot be removed and then retire into the interior with
their families and slaves, the Northern Conquests may prove to be
but barren. The climate may be a fatal enemy to the Federal Armies.
The Northern people may be unable or unwilling to continue the
enormous expenditure. They may prefer Separation to protracting the
War indefinitely. I confess, however, that I fear that a
protraction of the War during another year or longer, is a not less
probable result of the present posture of affairs, than either the
immediate subjugation of the South or the immediate recognition of
its independence<a name="FNanchor590"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_590">[590]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This itemization of Southern methods of resistance was in line
with Confederate threats at a moment when the sky looked black.
There was indeed much Southern talk of "retiring" into a
hypothetical defensible interior which impressed Englishmen, but
had no foundation in geographical fact. Meanwhile British attention
was eagerly fixed on the Northern advance, and it was at least
generally hoped <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"></a>[V1:pg
279]</span> that the projected attack on New Orleans and
McClellan's advance up the peninsula toward Richmond would bring to
a more definite status the conflict in America. Extreme Southern
sympathizers scouted the possibility of any conclusive Northern
success, ignoring, because ignorant, the importance of Grant's
western campaign. They "were quite struck aback" by the news of the
capture of New Orleans, April 25. "It took them three days to make
up their minds to believe it<a name="FNanchor591"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_591">[591]</a>," but even the capture of this the most
important commercial city of the South was not regarded as of great
importance in view of the eastern effort toward Richmond.</p>
<p>News of the operations in the peninsula was as slow in reaching
England as was McClellan's slow and cautious advance. It was during
this advance and previous to the capture of New Orleans that two
remarkable adventures toward a solution in America were made,
apparently wholly on individual initiative, by a Frenchman in
America and an Englishman in France. Mercier at Washington and
Lindsay at Paris conceived, quite independently, that the time had
come for projects of foreign mediation.</p>
<p>French opinion, like that expressed in England, appears to have
been that the Northern successes in the spring of 1862 might result
in such a rehabilitation of Northern self-esteem that suggestions
of now recognizing the <i>facts</i> of the situation and
acknowledging the independence of the South would not be
unfavourably received. In this sense Thouvenel wrote to Mercier,
privately, on March 13, but was careful to state that the word
"mediation" ought not to be uttered. His letter dilated, also, on
French manufacturing difficulties at home due to the lack of
cotton<a name="FNanchor592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592">[592]</a>.
This was in no way an instruction to Mercier, but the ideas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"></a>[V1:pg 280]</span>
expressed were broached by him in a conversation with Seward, only
to be met with such positive assertions of intention and ability
soon to recover the South as somewhat to stagger the French
Minister. He remarked, according to his report to Thouvenel, that
he wished it were possible to visit Richmond and assure himself
that there also they recognized the truth of Seward's statements,
upon which the latter at once offered to further such a trip.
Mercier asserted to Thouvenel that he was taken by surprise, having
foreseen no such eager acquiescence in a suggestion made <i>without
previous thought</i>, but that on consideration he returned to
Seward and accepted the proposal, outlining the substance of what
he intended to say at Richmond. He should there make clear that the
anxiety of France was above all directed toward peace as essential
to French commercial interests; that France had always regarded the
separation of North and South with regret; that the North was
evidently determined in its will to restore the Union; and, in
repetition, that France wished to aid in any way possible the early
cessation of war. Seward, wrote Mercier, told him to add that he,
personally, would welcome "the presence in the Senate" of any
persons whom the South wished to elect<a name=
"FNanchor593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593">[593]</a>.</p>
<p>Mercier, writes Bancroft, "from the first had been an impatient
sympathizer with the Confederacy, and he was quite devoid of the
balance and good judgment that characterized Lord Lyons." "Quite
unnecessarily, Seward <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_281"></a>[V1:pg 281]</span> helped him to make the
trip<a name="FNanchor594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594">[594]</a>." A
circumstance apparently not known to Bancroft was Mercier's
consultation with Lyons, before departure, in which were revealed
an initiative of the adventure, and a proposed representation to
the authorities in Richmond materially different from the report
made by Mercier to Thouvenel. These merit expanded treatment as new
light on a curious episode and especially as revealing the British
policy of the moment, represented in the person of the British
Minister in Washington<a name="FNanchor595"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_595">[595]</a>.</p>
<p>On April 10 Mercier came to Lyons, told him that he was about to
set out for Richmond and that he had "been for some little time
thinking of making this journey." He told of <i>making the
suggestion to Seward</i>, and that this "rather to his surprise"
had been "eagerly" taken up.</p>
<blockquote>"Monsieur Mercier observed that the object of vital
importance to France, and to England also, as he supposed, was to
put an end, as soon as possible, to the blockade, and generally to
a state of things which caused so grievous an interruption of the
trade between Europe and this country. It was, he said, possible
that he might hasten the attainment of this object by conferring
personally with the Secession leaders. He should frankly tell them
that to all appearances their cause was desperate; that their
Armies were beaten in all quarters; and that the time had arrived
when they ought to come to some arrangement, which would put an end
to a state of affairs ruinous to themselves and intolerable to
Europe. It was useless to expect any countenance from the European
Powers. Those Powers could but act on their avowed principles. They
would recognize any people which <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_282"></a>[V1:pg 282]</span> established its independence, but
they could not encourage the prolongation of a fruitless
struggle.<br>
<br>
"Monsieur Mercier thought that if the Confederates were very much
discouraged by their recent reverses, such language from the
Minister of a great European Power might be a knock-down blow
('Coup d'assommoir' was the expression he used) to them. It might
induce them to come to terms with the North. At all events it might
lead to an Armistice, under which trade might be immediately
resumed. He had (he told me) mentioned to Mr. Seward his notion of
using this language, and had added that of course as a Minister
accredited to the United States, and visiting Richmond with the
consent of the United States Government, he could not speak to the
Southern men of any other terms for ending the War than a return to
the Union.<br>
<br>
"Monsieur Mercier proceeded to say that Mr. Seward entirely
approved of the language he thus proposed to hold, and had
authorized him to say to the Southern leaders, not of course from
the United States Government, but from him Mr. Seward, personally,
that they had no spirit of vengeance to apprehend, that they would
be cordially welcomed back to their Seats in the Senate, and to
their due share of political influence. Mr. Seward added that he
had not said so much to any other person, but that he would tell
Monsieur Mercier that he was willing to risk his own political
station and reputation in pursuing a conciliatory course towards
the South, that he was ready to make this his policy and to stand
or fall by it."</blockquote>
<p>This was certainly sufficiently strong language to have pleased
the American Secretary of State, and if actually used at Richmond
to have constituted Mercier a valuable Northern agent. It cannot be
regarded as at all in harmony with Mercier's previous opinions, nor
as expressive of Thouvenel's views. Lyons was careful to refrain
from much comment on the matter of Mercier's proposed
representations at Richmond. He was more concerned that the trip
was to be made at all; was in fact much opposed to it, fearing that
it would appear like a break in that unity of French-British
attitude which was so desirable. Nor was <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_283"></a>[V1:pg 283]</span> he without
suspicion of a hidden French purpose to secure some special and
separate advantages in the way of prospective commercial relations
with the South. Mercier told Lyons that he knew he could not ask
Lyons to accompany him because of American "extreme susceptibility"
to any interference by Great Britain, but he thought of taking
Stoeckl, the Russian Minister, and that Stoeckl was "pleased with
the idea." Lyons frankly replied that he was glad to be relieved of
the necessity of declining to go and was sorry Mercier was
determined to proceed since this certainly looked like a break in
"joint policy," and he objected positively on the same ground to
Stoeckl's going<a name="FNanchor596"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_596">[596]</a>. Mercier yielded the latter point, but
argued that by informing Seward of his consultation with Lyons,
which he proposed doing, the former objection would be obviated.
Finding that Mercier "was bent on going," Lyons thought it best not
to object too much and confined his efforts to driving home the
idea that no opening should be given for a "separate agreement"
with the South.</p>
<blockquote>"I therefore entered with him into the details of his
plans, and made some suggestions as to his language and conduct. I
said that one delusion which he might find it desirable to remove
from the minds of men in the South, was that it would be possible
to inveigle France or any other great European Power into an
exclusive Alliance with them. I had reason to believe that some of
them imagine that this might be effected by an offer of great
commercial privileges to one Power, to the exclusion of others. I
hardly supposed that Mr. Jefferson Davis himself, or men of his
stamp could entertain so foolish a notion, but still it might be
well to eradicate it from any mind in which it had found
place<a name="FNanchor597"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_597">[597]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284"></a>[V1:pg 284]</span>
<p>Lyons saw Mercier "two or three times" between the tenth and
fourteenth and on the twelfth spoke to Seward about the trip,
"without saying anything to lead him to suppose that I had any
objection to it." This was intended to preserve the impression of
close harmony with France, and Lyons wrote, "I consider that the
result of my communications with M. Mercier entitles him to say
that he makes his journey to Richmond with my acquiescence<a name=
"FNanchor598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598">[598]</a>." Nevertheless
he both believed, and declared to Mercier, that the views expressed
on Southern weakening of determination were wholly erroneous, and
that neither North nor South was ready for any efforts, still less
mediation, looking toward peace. He prophesied failure of Mercier's
avowed hopes. His prophecy proved well founded. On April 28 Lyons
reported Mercier's account to him of the results of the journey.
Mercier returned to Washington on April 24, reported at once to
Seward the results of his trip, and on the same day called on
Lyons. Having conversed with Benjamin, the new Confederate
Secretary of State, he was now wholly convinced of the settled
determination of the South to maintain its independence, even under
extreme reverses. Upon enquiry by Lyons whether the South expected
European assistance, Mercier "replied that the Confederate leaders
professed to have abandoned all hope of succour from Europe," and
that confident in their own power they "desired no aid." Cautiously
adverting to his suspicion that Mercier's trip might have had in
view French commercial advantage, Lyons asked whether France had
received any proposals of benefit in return for recognition.
Mercier answered with a simple negative. He then further developed
the interview with Benjamin<a name="FNanchor599"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_599">[599]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285"></a>[V1:pg 285]</span>
<blockquote>"He said that he had spoken while at Richmond as a
friend of the Union, and a friend of all parties, but that the
particular language which he had intended to hold was entirely
inapplicable to the state of mind in which he found the
Confederates one and all. It was idle to tell them that they were
worsted on all sides; that the time was come for making terms with
the North. What he had said to them about the recognition of their
Independence was that the principal inducement to France to
recognize it would be a hope that her doing so would have a great
moral effect towards hastening peace; that at this moment it would
certainly not have any such effect; that it would embroil France
with the United States, and that would be all<a name=
"FNanchor600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600">[600]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thus none of the strong representations intended to be made by
Mercier to convince the South of the uselessness of further
resistance had, in fact, been made. In his report to Thouvenel,
Mercier stated that he had approached Benjamin with the simple
declaration "that the purpose of my journey was merely to assure
myself, for myself, of the true condition of things; and that I
called to beg him to aid me in attaining it." Since the proposed
strong representations were not reported to Thouvenel, either, in
the explanation given of the initiation of the trip, the doubt must
be entertained that Mercier ever intended to make them. They bear
the appearance of arguments to Seward--and in some degree also to
Lyons--made to secure acquiescence in his plan. The report to
Thouvenel omits also any reference to expressions, as narrated to
Lyons, about recognition of the Confederacy, or a "principal
inducement" thereto<a name="FNanchor601"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_601">[601]</a>. Mercier now declared to Lyons his own
views on recognition:</p>
<blockquote>"He was himself more than ever convinced that the
restoration of the old Union was impossible. He believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286"></a>[V1:pg 286]</span>
that, if the Powers of Europe exercised no influence, the War would
last for years. He conceived that the Independence of the South
must be recognized sooner or later; and in his opinion the
Governments of Europe should be on the watch for a favourable
opportunity of doing this in such a manner as to end the War. The
present opportunity would however, he thought, be particularly
unfavourable."</blockquote>
<p>Lyons writes:</p>
<blockquote>"I did not express any opinion as to the policy to be
eventually pursued by France or England, but I told Monsieur
Mercier that I entirely agreed with him in thinking that there was
nothing to do at the present moment but to watch
events."</blockquote>
<p>On the day following this interview, Lyons spoke to Seward of
Mercier's trip and was given a very different view of the situation
at Richmond. Seward said:</p>
<blockquote>"He himself was quite convinced, from Monsieur
Mercier's account of what had passed, that the Confederates were
about to make a last effort, that their last resources were brought
into play; that their last Armies were in the field. If they were
now defeated, they would accept the terms which would be offered
them. Their talking of retiring into the interior was idle. If the
United States were undisputed masters of the Border States and the
Sea Coast, there would be no occasion for any more fighting. Those
who chose to retire into the interior were welcome to do so, and to
stay there till they were tired."</blockquote>
<p>"The truth," wrote Lyons, "as to the state of feeling in the
South probably lies somewhere between Mr. Seward's views and those
of Monsieur Mercier." Lyons concluded his report of the whole
matter:</p>
<blockquote>"The result of Monsieur Mercier's journey has been to
bring him back precisely to the point at which he was three months
ago. The Federal successes which occurred afterwards had somewhat
shaken his conviction in the ultimate success of the South, and
consequently his opinions as to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_287"></a>[V1:pg 287]</span> the policy to be adopted by
France. The sentiments he now expresses are exactly those which he
expressed at the beginning of the year<a name=
"FNanchor602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602">[602]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Mercier was now again pressing for early
recognition of the South at the first favourable moment. On Lyons
the effect of the adventure to Richmond was just the reverse of
this; and on Russell also its influence was to cause some doubt of
Southern success. Appended to Lyons' report stands Russell's
initialled comment:</p>
<blockquote>"It is desirable to know what is the Interior to which
the Southern Confederates propose if beaten to retire. If in Arms
they will be pursued, if not in Arms their discontent will cause
but little embarrassment to their Conquerors. But can the country
be held permanently by the U.S. Armies if the Confederates have
small bodies in Arms resisting the authority of the U.S.
Congress?<br>
<br>
Any facts shewing the strength or weakness of the Union feeling in
the South will be of great value in forming a judgment on the final
issue."</blockquote>
<p>Seward, in conversation with Lyons, had said that to avoid
public misconceptions a newspaper statement would be prepared on
Mercier's trip. This appeared May 6, in the New York <i>Times</i>,
the paper more closely Seward's "organ" than any other throughout
the war, representing Mercier as having gone to Richmond by order
of Napoleon and with Lincoln's approval to urge the Confederates to
surrender and to encourage them to expect favourable terms. Lyons
commented on this article that the language attributed to Mercier
was "not very unlike that which he intended to hold," but that in
fact he had not used it<a name="FNanchor603"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_603">[603]</a>. Nor had Napoleon ordered the move.
Indeed everyone in London and Paris was much astonished, and many
were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288"></a>[V1:pg
288]</span> the speculations as to the meaning of Mercier's unusual
procedure. Russell was puzzled, writing "Que diable allait il faire
dans cette gal&eacute;re<a name="FNanchor604"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_604">[604]</a>?" and Cowley, at Paris, could give no
light, being assured by Thouvenel on first rumours of Mercier's
trip to Richmond that "he had not a notion that this could be
true<a name="FNanchor605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605">[605]</a>."
May 1, Cowley wrote, "The whole thing is inexplicable unless the
Emperor is at the bottom of it, which Thouvenel thinks is not the
case<a name="FNanchor606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606">[606]</a>."
The next day Thouvenel, having consulted Napoleon, was assured by
the latter that "he could not account for Monsieur Mercier's
conduct, and that he greatly regretted it," being especially
disturbed by a seeming break in the previous "complete harmony with
the British Representative" at Washington<a name=
"FNanchor607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607">[607]</a>. This was
reassuring to Russell, yet there is no question that Mercier's
conduct long left a certain suspicion in British official circles.
On May 2, also, Thouvenel wrote to Flahault in London of the
Emperor's displeasure, evidently with the intention that this
should be conveyed to Russell<a name="FNanchor608"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_608">[608]</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally the persons most excited were the two Confederate
agents in Europe. At first they believed Mercier must have had
secret orders from Napoleon, and were delighted; then on denials
made to Slidell by Thouvenel they feared Mercier was acting in an
unfavourable sense as Seward's agent. Later they returned to the
theory of Napoleon's private manipulation, and being confident of
his friendship were content to wait events<a name=
"FNanchor609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609">[609]</a>. Slidell had
just received assurance from M. Billault, through whom most of his
information came, "that the Emperor and all <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_289"></a>[V1:pg 289]</span> the Ministers
are favourable to our cause, have been so for the last year, and
are now quite as warmly so as they have ever been. M. Thouvenel is
of course excepted, but then he has no hostility<a name=
"FNanchor610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610">[610]</a>." But a greater
source of Southern hope at this juncture was another "diplomatic
adventure," though by no accredited diplomat, which antedated
Mercier's trip to Richmond and which still agitated not only the
Confederate agents, but the British Ministry as well.</p>
<p>This was the appearance of the British Member of Parliament,
Lindsay, in the r&ocirc;le of self-constituted Southern emissary to
Napoleon. Lindsay, as one of the principal ship-owners in England,
had long been an earnest advocate of more free commercial
intercourse between nations, supporting in general the principles
of Cobden and Bright, and being a warm personal friend of the
latter, though disagreeing with him on the American Civil War. He
had been in some sense a minor expert consulted by both French and
British Governments in the preparation of the commercial treaty of
1860, so that when on April 9 he presented himself to Cowley asking
that an audience with the Emperor be procured for him to talk over
some needed alterations in the Navigation Laws, the request seemed
reasonable, and the interview was arranged for April 11. On the
twelfth Lindsay reported to Cowley that the burden of Napoleon's
conversation, much to his surprise, was on American affairs<a name=
"FNanchor611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611">[611]</a>.</p>
<p>The Emperor, said Lindsay, expressed the conviction <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_290"></a>[V1:pg 290]</span> that re-union
between North and South was an impossibility, and declared that he
was ready to recognize the South "if Great Britain would set him
the example." More than once he had expressed these ideas to
England, but "they had not been attended to" and he should not try
again. He continued:</p>
<blockquote>"... that France ought not to interfere in the internal
affairs of the United States, but that the United States ought
equally to abstain from all interference in the internal concerns
of France; and that His Majesty considered that the hindrance
placed by the Northern States upon the exportation of cotton from
the South was not justifiable, and was tantamount to interference
with the legal commerce of France."</blockquote>
<p>He also "denied the efficiency of the blockade so established.
He had made observations in this sense to Her Majesty's Government,
but they had not been replied to." Then "His Majesty asked what
were the opinions of Her Majesty's Govt.; adding that if Her
Majesty's Govt. agreed with him as to the inefficiency of the
blockade, he was ready to send ships of war to co-operate with
others of Her Majesty to keep the Southern ports open." Finally
Napoleon requested Lindsay to see Cowley and find out what he
thought of these ideas.</p>
<p>Cowley told Lindsay he did not know of any "offer" whatever
having been made by France to England, that his (Cowley's) opinion
was "that it might be true that the North and the South would never
re-unite, but that it was not yet proved; that the efficiency of
the blockade was a legal and international question, and that upon
the whole it had been considered by Her Majesty's Govt. as
efficient, though doubtless many ships had been enabled to run it";
and "that at all events there could not be a more inopportune
moment for mooting the question both of the recognition of the
South and of the efficiency of the blockade. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_291"></a>[V1:pg 291]</span> The time was
gone by when such measures could, if ever, have been taken--for
every mail brought news of expeditions from the North acting with
success upon the South; and every day added to the efficiency of
the blockade"; and "that I did not think therefore that Her
Majesty's Govt. would consent to send a squadron to act as the
Emperor had indicated, but that I could only give a personal
opinion, which might be corrected if I was in error by Mr. Lindsay
himself seeing Lord Russell."</p>
<p>On April 13th a second interview took place between Lindsay and
Napoleon, of which Lindsay reported that having conveyed to
Napoleon Cowley's denial of any offer made to England, as well as a
contrary view of the situation, Napoleon:</p>
<blockquote>"... repeated the statement that two long despatches
with his opinion had been written to M. de Flahault, which had not
been attended to by Her Majesty's Government, and he expressed a
desire that Mr. Lindsay should return to London, lay His Majesty's
views before Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell, and bring their
answers direct to him as quickly as possible, His Majesty observing
that these matters were better arranged by private than official
hands.... Mr. Lindsay said that he had promised the Emperor to be
back in Paris on Thursday morning."</blockquote>
<p>In his letter to Russell, Cowley called all this a "nasty
intrigue." Cowley had asked Thouvenel for enlightenment, and
Thouvenel had denied all knowledge and declared that certainly no
such proposals as Lindsay reported the Emperor to have mentioned
had ever been sent to England. Cowley wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"My own conviction is, from Lindsay's conversations
with me, which are full of hesitations, and I fear much falsehood
hidden under apparent candour, that he has told the Emperor his own
views, and that those views are supported by the majority of the
people of England, and by the present Opposition in Parliament, who
would denounce <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292"></a>[V1:pg
292]</span> the blockade if in power; that he has found a willing
listener in the Emperor, who would gladly obtain cotton by any
means; and I am much mistaken if Lindsay will not attempt to make
political capital of his interviews with the Emperor with the
Opposition, and that you may hear of it in Parliament. I lose no
time therefore, in writing to you as Lindsay goes over to-night,
and will probably endeavour to see you and Lord Palmerston as soon
as possible<a name="FNanchor612"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_612">[612]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The close touch between Lindsay and the Southern agents is shown
by his conveyance to Slidell of the good news. Slidell was
jubilant, writing to Mason:</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Lindsay has had a long interview with the Emperor
who is prepared to act at once decidedly in our favour; he has
always been ready to do so and has twice made representations to
England, but has received evasive responses. He has now for the
third time given them but in a more decided tone. Mr. Lindsay will
give you all the particulars. This is entirely confidential but you
can say to Lord Campbell, Mr. Gregory, etc., that I now have
positive and <i>authoritative</i> evidence that France now waits
the assent of England for recognition and other more cogent
measures<a name="FNanchor613"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_613">[613]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Two days later Slidell made a report to Benjamin, which was in
substance very similar to that given by Lindsay to Cowley, though
more highly coloured as favourable to the South, but he added an
important feature which, as has been seen, was suspected by Cowley,
but which had not been stated to him. Napoleon had asked Lindsay to
see Derby and Disraeli, the leaders of the parliamentary
opposition, and inform them of his views--a suggestion which if
known to the British Ministry as coming from Napoleon could not
fail to arouse resentment. Slidell even believed that, failing
British participation, the Emperor might act separately in
recognition of the South<a name="FNanchor614"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_614">[614]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293"></a>[V1:pg 293]</span>
<p>April 15, Cowley, having received, privately, Russell's approval
of the language used to Lindsay and believing that Thouvenel was
about to write to Flahault on the interviews, felt it "necessary to
bring them also on my part officially to your [Russell's]
notice<a name="FNanchor615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615">[615]</a>."
This official report does not differ materially from that in
Cowley's private letter of the thirteenth, but omitted, naturally,
aspersions on Lindsay and suspicions of the use to which he might
put his information<a name="FNanchor616"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_616">[616]</a>. Cowley had held a long conversation with
Thouvenel, in which it was developed that the source of the
Emperor's views was Rouher, Minister of Commerce, who was very
anxious over the future of cotton supply. It appeared that Lindsay
in conversation with Thouvenel had affirmed that "<i>I</i> [Cowley]
<i>coincided in his views</i>." This exasperated Cowley, and he
resented Lindsay's "unofficial diplomacy," telling Thouvenel that
he "was placed in a false position by Mr. Lindsay's interference.
M. Thouvenel exclaimed that his own position was still more false,
and that he should make a point of seeing the Emperor, on the
following morning, and of ascertaining the extent of His Majesty's
participation in the proceeding." This was done, with the result
that Napoleon acknowledged that on Lindsay's request he had
authorized him to recount to Russell and Palmerston the views
expressed, but asserted that "he had not charged him to convey
those opinions." Cowley concluded his despatch:</p>
<blockquote>"Monsieur Thouvenel said that the Emperor did not
understand the intricacies of this question--that His Majesty had
confounded remarks conveyed in despatches with deliberate
proposals--that no doubt the French Government was more preoccupied
with the Cotton question than Her Majesty's Government seemed to
be, and this he (Thouvenel) had shewn in his communications with M.
de <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"></a>[V1:pg 294]</span>
Flahault, but that he knew too well the general opinions prevailing
in England to have made proposals. Nor, indeed, did he see what
proposals could have been made. He had endeavoured to shew both the
Emperor and M. Rouher, that to recognize the independence of the
South would not bring Cotton into the markets, while any
interference with the blockade would probably have produced a
collision. At the same time he could not conceal from me the just
anxiety he experienced to reopen the Cotton trade. Might not the
Northern States be induced to declare some one port Neutral, at
which the trade could be carried on?<br>
<br>
I said that the events which were now passing in America
demonstrated the prudence of the policy pursued by the two
Governments. The recognition of the South would not have prevented
the North from continuing its armaments and undertaking the
expedition now in progress, and a refusal to acknowledge the
blockade as efficient must have been followed by the employment of
force, on a question of extreme delicacy<a name=
"FNanchor617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617">[617]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Formal approval was given Cowley by Russell on April 16. In this
Russell stated that he agreed with Thouvenel the cotton situation
was alarming, but he added: "The evil is evident--not equally so
the remedy." He assured Cowley that "Her Majesty's Government wish
to take no step in respect to the Civil War in America except in
concert with France and upon full deliberation<a name=
"FNanchor618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618">[618]</a>." Meanwhile
Lindsay's diplomatic career had received a severe jolt in London.
Confidently addressing to Russell a request for an interview, he
received the reply "that I thought the best way for two Govts. to
communicate with each other was through their respective
Embassies.... He [Lindsay] rejoined that he feared you [Cowley] had
not stated the reason why the Emperor wished to make the proposal
through him rather than the usual channel, and again asked to see
me, but I declined to give any other answer, adding that you and
the French Ambassr. could make the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_295"></a>[V1:pg 295]</span> most Confidential as well as
Official Communications<a name="FNanchor619"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_619">[619]</a>." This rebuff was not regarded as final,
though exasperating, by Lindsay, nor by the Confederate agents, all
being agreed that Napoleon was about to take an active hand in
their favour. Lindsay returned to Paris accompanied by Mason, and
on April 18 had still another conversation with Napoleon. He
reported Russell's refusal of an interview, and that he had seen
Disraeli, but not Derby, who was ill. Disraeli had declared that he
believed Russell and Seward to have a "secret understanding" on the
blockade, but that if France should make a definite proposal it
would probably be supported by a majority in Parliament, and that
Russell would be compelled to assent in order to avoid a change of
Ministry. In this third interview with Lindsay expressions of
vexation with British policy were used by Napoleon (according to
Slidell), but he now intimated that he was waiting to learn the
result of the Northern effort to capture New Orleans, an event
which "he did not anticipate," but which, if it occurred, "might
render it inexpedient to act<a name="FNanchor620"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_620">[620]</a>."</p>
<p>Evidently the wedge was losing its force. Mason, returning to
London, found that the "pulsations" in Paris had no English
repetition. He wrote that Lindsay, failing to reach Russell, had
attempted to get at Palmerston, but <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_296"></a>[V1:pg 296]</span> with no success. Thereupon
Lindsay turning to the Opposition had visited Disraeli a second
time and submitted to him Palmerston's rebuff. The strongest
expression that fell from Disraeli was--"if it is found that the
Emperor and Russell are at issue on the question the session of
Parliament would not be as quiet as had been anticipated." This was
scant encouragement, for Disraeli's "if" was all important. Yet "on
the whole Lindsay is hopeful," wrote Mason in conclusion<a name=
"FNanchor621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621">[621]</a>. Within a
fortnight following arrived the news of the capture of New Orleans,
an event upon which Seward had postulated the relief of a European
scarcity of cotton and to Southern sympathizers a serious blow. May
13, Cowley reported that the Emperor had told him, personally, that
"he quite agreed that nothing was to be done for the moment but to
watch events<a name="FNanchor622"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_622">[622]</a>." Thouvenel asked Slidell as to the
effect of the loss of New Orleans, and received the frank answer,
"that it would be most disastrous, as it would give the enemy the
control of the Mississippi and its tributaries, [but] that it would
not in any way modify the fixed purpose of our people to carry on
the war even to an extermination<a name="FNanchor623"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_623">[623]</a>." Mason, a Virginian, and like nearly all
from his section, never fully realizing the importance of the
Confederate South-West, his eyes fixed on the campaigns about
Richmond, was telling the "nervous amongst our friends" that New
Orleans would "form a barren acquisition to the enemy, and will on
our side serve only as a stimulant<a name=
"FNanchor624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624">[624]</a>."</p>
<p>If the South needed such stimulants she was certainly getting
repeated doses in the three months from February to May, 1862. In
England, Lindsay might be hopeful of a movement by the Tory
opposition, but thought it wiser to postpone for a time further
pressure in that direction. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_297"></a>[V1:pg 297]</span> May 8, Henry Adams could write to
his brother of British public opinion, "there is no doubt that the
idea here is as strong as ever that we must ultimately fail<a name=
"FNanchor625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625">[625]</a>," but on May
16, that "the effect of the news here [of New Orleans] has been
greater than anything yet ... the <i>Times</i> came out and gave
fairly in that it had been mistaken; it had believed Southern
accounts and was deceived by them. This morning it has an article
still more remarkable and intimates for the first time that it sees
little more chance for the South. There is, we think, a preparation
for withdrawing their belligerent declaration and acknowledging
again the authority of the Federal Government over all the national
territory to be absolute and undisputed. One more victory will
bring us up to this, I am confident<a name=
"FNanchor626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626">[626]</a>."</p>
<p>This was mistaken confidence. Nor did governmental reaction keep
pace with Southern depression or Northern elation; the British
Ministry was simply made more determined to preserve strict
neutrality and to restrain its French partner in a "wait for
events" policy. The "one more victory" so eagerly desired by Henry
Adams was not forthcoming, and the attention, now all focused on
McClellan's slow-moving campaign, waited in vain for the
demonstration of another and more striking evidence of Northern
power--the capture of the Confederate Capital, Richmond.
McClellan's delays coincided with a bruiting of the news at
Washington that foreign Powers were about to offer mediation. This
was treated at some length in the semi-official <i>National
Intelligencer</i> of May 16 in an article which Lyons thought
inspired by Seward, stating that mediation would be welcome if
offered for the purpose of re-union, but would otherwise be
resented, a view which Lyons thought fairly represented the
situation<a name="FNanchor627"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_627">[627]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298"></a>[V1:pg 298]</span>
<p>There can be little doubt that this Washington rumour was
largely the result of the very positive opinion held by Mercier of
ultimate Southern success and his somewhat free private
communications. He may, indeed, have been talking more freely than
usual exactly because of anxiety at Northern success, for
McClellan, so far as was then known, was steadily, if slowly,
progressing toward a victory. Mercier's most recent instruction
from Thouvenel gave him no authority to urge mediation, yet he
thought the moment opportune for it and strongly urged this plan on
Lyons. The latter's summary of this and his own analysis of the
situation were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"M. Mercier thinks it quite within the range of
possibility that the South may be victorious both in the battle in
Virginia and in that in Tennessee. He is at all events quite
confident that whether victorious or defeated, they will not give
in, and he is certainly disposed to advise his Government to
endeavour to put an end to the war by intervening on the first
opportunity. He is, however, very much puzzled to devise any mode
of intervention, which would have the effect of reviving French
trade and obtaining cotton. I should suppose he would think it
desirable to go to great lengths to stop the war; because he
believes that the South will not give in until the whole country is
made desolate and that the North will very soon be led to proclaim
immediate emancipation, which would stop the cultivation of cotton
for an indefinite time.<br>
<br>
I listen and say little when he talks of intervention. It appears
to me to be a dangerous subject of conversation. There is a good
deal of truth in M. Mercier's anticipations of evil, but I do not
see my way to doing any good.<br>
<br>
If one is to conjecture what the state of things will be a month or
six weeks hence, one may "guess" that McClellan will be at
Richmond, having very probably got there without much real
fighting. I doubt his getting farther this summer, if so
far....<br>
<br>
The campaign will not be pushed with any vigour during the summer.
It may be begun again in the Autumn. Thus, so far as Trade and
Cotton are concerned, we may be next <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_299"></a>[V1:pg 299]</span> Autumn, just in the situation we
are now. If the South really defeated either or both the Armies
opposed to them I think it would disgust the North with the war,
rather than excite them to fresh efforts. If the armies suffer much
from disease, recruiting will become difficult. The credit of the
Government has hitherto been wonderfully kept up, but it would not
stand a considerable reverse in the field. It is possible, under
such circumstances that a Peace Party might arise; and perhaps just
<i>possible</i> that England and France might give weight to such a
Party<a name="FNanchor628"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_628">[628]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In brief, Lyons was all against either intervention or mediation
unless a strong reaction toward peace should come in the North, and
even then regarded the wisdom of such a policy as only "just
<i>possible</i>." Nor was Russell inclined to depart from
established policy. He wrote to Lyons at nearly the same time:</p>
<blockquote>"The news from York Town, New Orleans, and Corinth
seems to portend the conquest of the South. We have now to see
therefore, whether a few leaders or the whole population entertain
those sentiments of alienation and abhorrence which were so freely
expressed to M. Mercier by the Confederate Statesmen at Richmond. I
know not how to answer this question. But there are other questions
not less important to be solved in the North. Will the
Abolitionists succeed in proclaiming freedom to the Slaves of all
those who have resisted? I guess not.<br>
<br>
But then the Union will be restored with its old disgrace and its
old danger. I confess I do not see any way to any fair solution
except separation--but that the North will not hear of--nor in the
moment of success would it be of any use to give them unpalatable
advice<a name="FNanchor629"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_629">[629]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Two days preceding this letter, Thouvenel, at last fully
informed of Mercier's trip to Richmond, instructed him that France
had no intention to depart from her attitude of strict neutrality
and that it was more than ever necessary to wait events<a name=
"FNanchor630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630">[630]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"></a>[V1:pg 300]</span>
<p>Mercier's renewed efforts to start a movement toward mediation
were then wholly personal. Neither France nor Great Britain had as
yet taken up this plan, nor were they likely to so long as Northern
successes were continued. In London, Mason, suffering a reaction
from his former high hopes, summed up the situation in a few words:
"This Government passive and ignorant, France alert and mysterious.
The Emperor alone knows what is to come out of it, and he keeps his
own secret<a name="FNanchor631"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_631">[631]</a>." The Southern play, following the
ministerial rebuff to Lindsay, was now to keep quiet and extended
even to discouraging public demonstrations against governmental
inaction. Spence had prevented such a demonstration by cotton
operators in Liverpool. "I have kept them from moving as a matter
of judgment. If either of the Southern armies obtain such a victory
as I think probable, then a move of this kind may be made with
success and power, whilst at the wrong time for it havoc only would
have resulted<a name="FNanchor632"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_632">[632]</a>." The wrong time for Southern pressure on
Russell was conceived by Seward to be the right time for the North.
Immediately following the capture of New Orleans he gave positive
instructions to Dayton in Paris and Adams in London to propose the
withdrawal of the declaration admitting Southern belligerent
rights. Thouvenel replied with some asperity on the folly of
Seward's demand, and made a strong representation of the necessity
of France to obtain cotton and tobacco<a name=
"FNanchor633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633">[633]</a>. Adams, with
evident reluctance, writing, "I had little expectation of success,
but I felt it my duty at once to execute the orders," advanced with
Russell the now threadbare and customary arguments on the
Proclamation of Neutrality, and received the usual refusal to alter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301"></a>[V1:pg 301]</span>
British policy<a name="FNanchor634"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_634">[634]</a>. If Seward was sincere in asking for a
retraction of belligerent rights to the South he much mistook
European attitude; if he was but making use of Northern victories
to return to a high tone of warning to Europe--a tone serviceable
in causing foreign governments to step warily--his time was well
chosen. Certainly at Washington Lyons did not regard very seriously
Seward's renewal of demand on belligerency. Satisfied that there
was no immediate reason to require his presence in America, ill and
fearing the heat of summer, he had asked on May 9 for permission to
take leave of absence for a trip home. On June 6 he received this
permission, evidence that Russell also saw no cause for anxiety,
and on June 13 he took leave of Lincoln.</p>
<blockquote>"I had quite an affectionate parting with the President
this morning. He told me, as is his wont, a number of stories more
or less decorous, but all he said having any bearing on political
matters was: 'I suppose my position makes people in England think a
great deal more of me than I deserve, pray tell 'em I mean 'em no
harm<a name="FNanchor635"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_635">[635]</a>.'"</blockquote>
<p>Fully a month had now elapsed in London since the arrival of
news on any striking military event in America. New Orleans was an
old story, and while in general it was believed that Richmond must
fall before McClellan's army, the persistence of Southern fervid
declarations that they would never submit gave renewed courage to
their British friends. Lindsay was now of the opinion that it might
be wise, after all, to make some effort in Parliament, and since
the Washington mediation rumours were becoming current in London
also, notice was given of a motion demanding of the Government
that, associating itself with France, an offer of mediation be made
to the contending <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_302"></a>[V1:pg 302]</span> parties in America. Motions on
recognition and on the blockade had been tried and had failed. Now
the cry was to be "peaceful mediation" to put an end to a terrible
war. Friends of the South were not united in this adventure. Spence
advised Lindsay to postpone it, but the latter seemed determined to
make the effort<a name="FNanchor636"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_636">[636]</a>. Probably he was still smarting under his
reverse of April. Possibly also he was aware of a sudden sharp
personal clash between Palmerston and Adams that might not be
without influence on governmental attitude--perhaps might even
indicate a governmental purpose to alter its policy.</p>
<p>This clash was caused by a personal letter written by Palmerston
to Adams on the publication in the <i>Times</i> of General Butler's
famous order in New Orleans authorizing Federal soldiers to treat
as "women of the town" those women who publicly insulted Northern
troops. The British press indulged in an ecstasy of vicious writing
about this order similar to that on the Northern "barbarity" of the
Stone Fleet episode. Palmerston's letters to Adams and the replies
received need no further notice here, since they did not in fact
affect British policy, than to explain that Palmerston wrote in
extreme anger, apparently, and with great violence of language, and
that Adams replied with equal anger, but in very dignified if
irritating terms<a name="FNanchor637"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_637">[637]</a>. In British opinion Butler's order was an
incitement to his soldiers to commit atrocities; Americans
understood it as merely an authorization to return insult for
insult. In fact the order promptly put a stop to attacks on
Northern soldiers, whether by act or word, and all disorder ceased.
Palmerston was quick to accept the British view, writing to Adams,
"it is difficult if not impossible to express adequately the
disgust which must be excited in the mind of every honourable man
by the general order of General Butler...." <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_303"></a>[V1:pg 303]</span> "If the Federal
government chooses to be served by men capable of such revolting
outrages, they must submit to abide by the deserved opinion which
mankind will form of their conduct<a name=
"FNanchor638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638">[638]</a>." This
extraordinary letter was written on June 11. Adams was both angry
and perturbed, since he thought the letter might indicate an
intention to change British policy and that Palmerston was but
laying the ground for some "vigorous" utterance in Parliament,
after his wont when striking out on a new line. He was further
confirmed in this view by an editorial in the <i>Times</i> on June
12, hinting at a coming mediation, and by news from France that
Persigny was on his way to London to arrange such a step. But
however much personally aggrieved, Adams was cool as a diplomat.
His first step was to write a brief note to Palmerston enquiring
whether he was to consider the letter as addressed to him
"officially ... or purely as a private expression of sentiment
between gentlemen<a name="FNanchor639"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_639">[639]</a>."</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Palmerston and Russell were
contemplating a change of policy--rather the reverse. But it does
appear that Palmerston wished to be able to state in Parliament
that he had taken Adams to task for Butler's order, so that he
might meet an enquiry already placed on the question paper as to
the Ministry's intentions in the matter. This question was due for
the sitting of June 13, and on that day Russell wrote to Palmerston
that he should call Butler's order "brutal" and that Palmerston
might use the term "infamous" if preferred, adding, "I do not see
why we should not represent in a friendly way that the usages of
war do not sanction such conduct<a name="FNanchor640"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_640">[640]</a>." This was very different from the tone
used by Palmerston. His letter was certainly no "friendly way."
Again on the same day Russell wrote to Palmerston:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304"></a>[V1:pg 304]</span>
<blockquote>"Adams has been here in a dreadful state about the
letter you have written him about Butler.<br>
<br>
I declined to give him any opinion and asked him to do nothing more
till I had seen or written to you.<br>
<br>
What you say of Butler is true enough, tho' he denies your
interpretation of the order.<br>
<br>
But it is not clear that the President approves of the order, and I
think if you could add something to the effect that you respect the
Government of President Lincoln, and do not wish to impute to them
the fault of Butler it might soothe him.<br>
<br>
If you could withdraw the letter altogether it would be the best.
But this you may not like to do<a name="FNanchor641"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_641">[641]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>It is apparent that Russell did not approve of Palmerston's move
against Adams nor of any "vigorous" language in Parliament, and as
to the last, he had his way, for the Government, while disapproving
Butler's order, was decidedly mild in comment. As to the letter,
Adams, the suspicion proving unfounded that an immediate change of
policy was intended, returned to the attack as a matter of personal
prestige. It was not until June 15 that Palmerston replied to Adams
and then in far different language seeking to smooth the Minister's
ruffled feathers, yet making no apology and not answering Adams'
question. Adams promptly responded with vigour, June 16, again
asking his question as to the letter being official or personal,
and characterizing Palmerston's previous assertions as "offensive
imputations." He also again approached Russell, who stated that he
too had written to Palmerston about his letter, but had received no
reply, and he acknowledged that Palmerston's proceeding was
"altogether irregular<a name="FNanchor642"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_642">[642]</a>." In the end Palmerston was brought, June
19, to write a long and somewhat rambling reply to Adams, in effect
still evading the question put him, though acknowledging that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305"></a>[V1:pg 305]</span> the
"Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is the regular official
organ for communications...." In conclusion he expressed
gratification that reports from Lord Lyons showed Butler's
authority at New Orleans had been curtailed by Lincoln. The next
day Adams answered interpreting Palmerston as withdrawing his
"imputations" but stating plainly that he would not again submit
"to entertain any similar correspondence<a name=
"FNanchor643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643">[643]</a>."</p>
<p>Adams had been cautious in pushing for an answer until he knew
there was to be no change in British policy. Indeed Palmerston's
whole move may even have been intended to ease the pressure for a
change in that policy. On the very day of Adams' first talk with
Russell, friends of the South thought the <i>Times</i> editorial
indicated "that some movement is to be made at last, and I doubt
not we are to thank the Emperor for it<a name=
"FNanchor644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644">[644]</a>." But on this
day also Russell was advising Palmerston to state in Parliament
that "We have not received at present any proposal from France to
offer mediation and no intention at present exists to offer it on
our part<a name="FNanchor645"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_645">[645]</a>." This was the exact language used by
Palmerston in reply to Hopwood<a name="FNanchor646"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_646">[646]</a>. Mason again saw his hopes dwindling, but
was assured by Lindsay that all was not yet lost, and that he would
"still hold his motion under consideration<a name=
"FNanchor647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647">[647]</a>." Lindsay,
according to his own account, had talked very large in a letter to
Russell, but knew privately, and so informed Mason, that the
Commons would not vote for his motion if opposed by the Government,
and so intended to postpone it<a name="FNanchor648"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_648">[648]</a>. The proposed motion <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_306"></a>[V1:pg 306]</span> was now one for
recognition instead of mediation, a temporary change of plan due to
Palmerston's answer to Hopwood on June 13. But whatever the terms
of the motion favourable to the South, it was evident the
Government did not wish discussion at the moment, and hesitancy
came over pro-Southern friends. Slidell, in despair, declared that
for his part he intended, no matter with what prospect of success,
to <i>demand</i> recognition from France<a name=
"FNanchor649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649">[649]</a>. This alarmed
Mason's English advisers, and he wrote at once strongly urging
against such a step, for if the demand were presented and refused
there would be no recourse but to depart for home<a name=
"FNanchor650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650">[650]</a>. He thought
Lindsay's motion dying away for on consultation with "different
parties, including Disraeli, Seymour Fitzgerald and Roebuck," it
"has been so far reduced and diluted ... as to make it only
expressive of the opinion of the House that the present posture of
affairs in America made the question of the recognition of the
Confederate States worth the serious consideration of the
Government. It was so modified to prevent the Ministry making an
issue upon it...." There was "no assurance that it would be
sustained ... even in that form." Lindsay had determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"></a>[V1:pg 307]</span> to
postpone his motion "for a fortnight, so that all expectation from
this quarter for the present is dished, and we must wait for 'King
Cotton' to turn the screw still further<a name=
"FNanchor651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651">[651]</a>." On June, 20
Lindsay gave this notice of postponement, and no parliamentary
comment was made<a name="FNanchor652"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_652">[652]</a>. It was a moment of extreme depression
for the Confederate agents in Europe. Slidell, yielding to Mason's
pleas, gave up his idea of demanding recognition and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"The position of our representatives in Europe is
painful and almost humiliating; it might be tolerated if they could
be consoled by the reflection that their presence was in any way
advantageous to their cause but I am disposed to believe that we
would have done better to withdraw after our first interview with
Russell and Thouvenel<a name="FNanchor653"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_653">[653]</a>."</blockquote>

Yellow Book." It is interesting that the concluding paragraphs of
this report of April 28, as printed in the <i>Tribune</i>, are not
given in the printed volume of <i>Documents Diplomatiques</i>,
1862. These refer to difficulties about cotton and to certain
pledges given by Seward as to cessation of illegal interferences
with French vessels. How the <i>Tribune</i> secured these
paragraphs, if authentic, is not clear. The whole purpose of the
publication was an attack by Horace Greeley, editor, on Seward in
an effort to cause his removal from the Cabinet. See Bancroft,
<i>Seward</i>, II, 371-2.</blockquote>

Bancroft's account is based on the <i>Tribune</i> translation and
on Seward's own comments to Weed and Bigelow. <i>Ibid.</i>,

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_595"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor595">[595]</a> Newton. <i>Lord Lyons</i>, I, pp. 82-85,
gives an account of the initiation of Mercier's trip and prints
Lyons' private letter to Russell of April 25, describing the
results, but does not bring out sufficiently Lyons' objections and
misgivings. Newton thinks that Mercier "whether instructed from
home or not ... after the manner of French diplomatists of the
period ... was probably unable to resist the temptation of trying
to effect a striking <i>coup</i>...."</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_596"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor596">[596]</a> Stoeckl's report does not agree with
Mercier's statement. He wrote that he had been asked to accompany
Mercier but had refused and reported a conversation with Seward in
which the latter declared the time had not yet come for mediation,
that in any case France would not be accepted in that r&ocirc;le,
and that if ever mediation should become acceptable, Russia would
be asked to act (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to F.O., April 23-May 5,
1862. No. 927).</blockquote>

Mercier's visit, describing the language used in almost exactly the

was attached by Benjamin to Mercier's visit is also indicated by
the fact that he did not write to Slidell about it until July.

motion. I have sent them to him to-night, and I have embraced<br>
the opportunity of opening my mind to his Lordship. I have<br>
told him that I have postponed my motion in courtesy to<br>
him--that the sympathy of nine-tenths of the members of the<br>
House was in favour of immediate recognition, and that even<br>
if the Government was not prepared to accept my motion, a<br>
majority of votes might have been obtained in its<br>
favour--that a majority of votes <i>would</i> be obtained
within<br>
the next fortnight, and I expressed the most earnest hope<br>
that the Government would move (as the country, and France,<br>
are most anxious for them to do so) and thus prevent the<br>
necessity of any private member undertaking a duty which<br>
belonged to the Executive.<br>

"I further told his Lordship that recognition was a

which no one would deny us the form of exercising, that the<br>
fear of war if we exercised it was a delusion. That the<br>
majority of the leading men in the Northern States would<br>
thank us for exercising it, and that even Seward himself<br>
might be glad to see it exercised so as to give him an excuse<br>
for getting out of the terrible war into which he had dragged<br>
his people. I further said, that if the question is settled<br>
<i>without</i> our recognition of the South, he might <i>rest<br>
certain</i> that the Northern Armies <i>would</i> be marched
into<br>
Canada. I hope my note may produce the desired results, and<br>
thus get the Government to take the matter in hand, for <i>sub<br>
rosa</i>, I saw that the House was not <i>yet</i> prepared to
vote,<br>
and the question is far too grave to waste time upon it in<br>
idle talk, even if talk, without action, did no harm."</blockquote>

<h3>KING COTTON</h3>
<br>
<p>For two weeks there was no lightening of Southern depression in
England. But on June 28 McClellan had been turned back from his
advance on Richmond by Lee, the new commander of the Army of
Virginia, and the much heralded Peninsular campaign was recognized
to have been a disastrous failure. Earlier Northern victories were
forgotten and the campaigns in the West, still progressing
favourably for the North, were ignored or their significance not
understood. Again, to English eyes, the war in America approached a
stalemate. The time had come with the near adjournment of
Parliament when, if ever, a strong Southern effort must be made,
and the time seemed propitious. Moreover by July, 1862, it was
hoped that soon, in the cotton districts, the depression steadily
increasing since the beginning of the war, would bring an ally to
the Southern cause. Before continuing the story of Parliamentary
and private efforts by the friends of the South it is here
necessary to review the cotton situation--now rapidly becoming a
matter of anxious concern to both friend and foe of the North and
in less degree to the Ministry itself.</p>
<p>"King Cotton" had long been a boast with the South. "Perhaps no
great revolution," says Bancroft, "was ever begun with such
convenient and soothing theories as those <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_2"></a>[V2:pg 2]</span> that were
expounded and believed at the time of the organization of the
Confederacy.... In any case, hostilities could not last long, for
France and Great Britain must have what the Confederacy alone could
supply, and therefore they could be forced to aid the South, as a
condition precedent to relief from the terrible distress that was
sure to follow a blockade<a name="FNanchor654"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_654">[654]</a>." This confidence was no new development.
For ten years past whenever Southern threats of secession had been
indulged in, the writers and politicians of that section had
expanded upon cotton as the one great wealth-producing industry of
America and as the one product which would compel European
acquiescence in American policy, whether of the Union, before 1860,
or of the South if she should secede. In the financial depression
that swept the Northern States in 1857 <i>De Bow's Review</i>, the
leading financial journal of the South, declared: "The wealth of
the South is permanent and real, that of the North fugitive and
fictitious. Events now transpiring expose the fiction, as humbug
after humbug explodes<a name="FNanchor655"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_655">[655]</a>." On March 4, 1858, Senator Hammond of
South Carolina, asked in a speech, "What would happen if no cotton
was furnished for three years? I will not stop to depict what
everyone can imagine, but this is certain: England would topple
headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her save the
South. No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares
make war upon it. Cotton <i>is</i> King<a name=
"FNanchor656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656">[656]</a>." Two years
later, writing before the elections of 1860 in which the main
question was that of the territorial expansion of slavery, this
same Southern statesman expressed himself as believing that "the
slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the world....
Cotton, rice, tobacco and naval stores command the world; and we
have sense enough to know <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_3"></a>[V2:pg 3]</span> it, and are sufficiently Teutonic to
carry it out successfully<a name="FNanchor657"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_657">[657]</a>."</p>
<p>These quotations indicative of Southern faith in cotton might be
amplified and repeated from a hundred sources.</p>
<p>Moreover this faith in the possession of ultimate power went
hand in hand with the conviction that the South, more than any
other quarter of the world, produced to the benefit of mankind. "In
the three million bags of cotton," said a writer in <i>De Bow's
Review</i>, "the slave-labour annually throws upon the world for
the poor and naked, we are doing more to advance civilization ...
than all the canting philanthropists of New England and Old England
will do in centuries. Slavery is the backbone of the Northern
commercial as it is of the British manufacturing system<a name=
"FNanchor658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658">[658]</a>...." Nor was
this idea unfamiliar to Englishmen. Before the Civil War was under
way Charles Greville wrote to Clarendon:</p>
<blockquote>"Any war will be almost sure to interfere with the
cotton crops, and this is really what affects us and what we care
about. With all our virulent abuse of slavery and slave-owners, and
our continual self-laudation on that subject, we are just as
anxious for, and as much interested in, the prosperity of the
slavery interest in the Southern States as the Carolinan and
Georgian planters themselves, and all Lancashire would deplore a
successful insurrection of the slaves, if such a thing were
possible<a name="FNanchor659"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_659">[659]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On December 20, 1860, South Carolina led the march in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_4"></a>[V2:pg 4]</span>
secession. Fifteen days earlier the British consul at Charleston,
Bunch, reported a conversation with Rhett, long a leader of the
Southern cause and now a consistent advocate of secession, in which
Rhett developed a plan of close commercial alliance with England as
the most favoured nation, postulating the dependence of Great
Britain on the South for cotton--"upon which supposed axiom, I
would remark," wrote Bunch, "all their calculations are
based<a name="FNanchor660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660">[660]</a>."
Such was, indeed, Southern calculation. In January, 1861, <i>De
Bow's Review</i> contained an article declaring that "the first
demonstration of blockade of the Southern ports would be swept away
by the English fleets of observation hovering on the Southern
coasts, to protect English commerce, and especially the free flow
of cotton to English and French factories.... A stoppage of the raw
material ... would produce the most disastrous political
results--if not a revolution in England. This is the language of
English statesmen, manufacturers, and merchants, in Parliament and
at cotton associations' debates, and it discloses the truth<a name=
"FNanchor661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661">[661]</a>."</p>
<p>The historical student will find but few such British utterances
at the moment, and these few not by men of great weight either in
politics or in commerce. The South was labouring under an obsession
and prophesied results accordingly. So strong was this obsession
that governmental foreign policy neglected all other considerations
and the first Commission to Europe had no initial instructions save
to demand recognition<a name="FNanchor662"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_662">[662]</a>. The failure of that Commission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_5"></a>[V2:pg 5]</span> the
prompt British acquiescence in the blockade, were harsh blows to
Southern confidence but did not for a long time destroy the faith
in the power of cotton. In June, 1861, Bunch wrote that there was
still a firm belief that "Great Britain will make any sacrifice,
even of principle or of honour, to prevent the stoppage of the
supply of cotton," and he enclosed a copy of an article in the
<i>Charleston Mercury</i> of June 4, proclaiming: "The cards are in
our hands, and we intend to play them out to <i>the bankruptcy of
every cotton factory in Great Britain and France, or the
acknowledgment of our independence</i><a name=
"FNanchor663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663">[663]</a>." As late as
March, 1862, Bunch was still writing of this Southern faith in
cotton and described the newly-made appointment of Benjamin as
Secretary of State as partly due to the fact that he was the leader
of the "King Cotton" theory of diplomacy<a name=
"FNanchor664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664">[664]</a>. It was not
until the war was well nigh over that British persistence in
neutrality, in spite of undoubted hardships caused by the lack of
cotton, opened Southern eyes. Pollard, editor of a leading Richmond
newspaper, and soon unfriendly to the administration of Jefferson
Davis, summed up in <i>The Lost Cause</i> his earlier criticisms of
Confederate foreign policy:</p>
<blockquote>"'Cotton,' said the Charleston <i>Mercury</i>, 'would
bring England to her knees.' The idea was ludicrous enough that
England and France would instinctively or readily fling themselves
into a convulsion, which their great politicians <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_6"></a>[V2:pg 6]</span> saw was the most
tremendous one of modern times. But the puerile argument, which
even President Davis did not hesitate to adopt, about the power of
'King Cotton,' amounted to this absurdity: that the great and
illustrious power of England would submit to the ineffable
humiliation of acknowledging its dependency on the infant
Confederacy of the South, and the subserviency of its empire, its
political interests and its pride, to a single article of trade
that was grown in America<a name="FNanchor665"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_665">[665]</a>!"</blockquote>
<p>But irrespective of the extremes to which Southern confidence in
cotton extended the actual hardships of England were in all truth
serious enough to cause grave anxiety and to supply an argument to
Southern sympathizers. The facts of the "Lancashire Cotton Famine"
have frequently been treated by historians at much length<a name=
"FNanchor666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666">[666]</a> and need here
but a general review. More needed is an examination of some of the
erroneous deductions drawn from the facts and especially an
examination of the extent to which the question of cotton supply
affected or determined British governmental policy toward
America.</p>
<p>English cotton manufacturing in 1861 held a position of
importance equalled by no other one industry. Estimates based on
varying statistics diverge as to exact proportions, but all agree
in emphasizing the pre-eminent place of Lancashire in determining
the general prosperity of the nation. Surveying the English, not
the whole British, situation it is estimated that there were 2,650
factories of which 2,195 were in Lancashire and two adjacent
counties. These employed 500,000 operatives and consumed a thousand
million pounds of cotton each year<a name=
"FNanchor667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667">[667]</a>. An editorial
in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_7"></a>[V2:pg 7]</span>
<i>Times</i>, September 19, 1861, stated that one-fifth of the
entire English population was held to be dependent, either directly
or indirectly, on the prosperity of the cotton districts<a name=
"FNanchor668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668">[668]</a>, and therefore
also dependent on the source of supply, the Confederate South,
since statistics, though varying, showed that the raw cotton
supplied from America constituted anywhere from 78 to 84 per cent.
of the total English importation<a name="FNanchor669"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_669">[669]</a>.</p>
<p>The American crop of 1860 was the largest on record, nearly
4,000,000 bales, and the foreign shipments, without question
hurried because of the storm-cloud rising at home, had been
practically completed by April, 1861. Of the 3,500,000 bales sent
abroad, Liverpool, as usual, received the larger portion<a name=
"FNanchor670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670">[670]</a>. There was,
then, no immediate shortage of supply when war came in America,
rather an unusual accumulation of raw stocks, even permitting some
reshipment to the Northern manufacturing centres of America where
the scarcity then brought high prices. In addition, from December,
1860, to at least April, 1861, there had been somewhat of a slump
in demand for raw cotton by British manufacturers due to an
over-production of goods in the two previous years. There had been
a temporary depression in 1856-57 caused by a general financial
crisis, but early in 1858 restored confidence and a tremendous
demand from the Far East--India especially--set the mills running
again on full time, while many new mills were brought into
operation. But by May, 1860, the mills had caught up with the heavy
demands and the rest of the year saw uncertainty of operations and
brought expressions of fear that the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_8"></a>[V2:pg 8]</span> "plunge" to produce had been
overdone. Manufactured stocks began to accumulate, and money was
not easy since 1860 brought also a combination of events--deficient
grain harvest at home, withdrawal of gold from England to France
for investment in French public works, demand of America for gold
in place of goods, due to political uncertainties there--which
rapidly raised the discount rate from two and one half per cent. in
January, 1860, to six in December. By the end of April, 1861, the
Board of Trade Returns indicated that the cotton trade was in a
dangerous situation, with large imports of raw cotton and decreased
exports of goods<a name="FNanchor671"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_671">[671]</a>. The news of war actually begun in
America came as a temporary relief to the English cotton trade and
in the prospect of decreased supply prices rose, saving many
manufacturers from impending difficulties. A few mills had already
begun to work on part-time because of trade depression. The
<i>immediate</i> effect of Lincoln's blockade proclamation was to
check this movement, but by October it had again begun and this
time because of the rapid increase in the price of raw cotton as
compared with the slower advance of the price of goods<a name=
"FNanchor672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672">[672]</a>.</p>
<p>In substance the principal effect of the War on the English
cotton trade for the first seven or eight months was felt, not in
the manufacturing districts but in the Liverpool speculative and
importing markets of raw cotton. Prices rose steadily to over a
shilling a pound in October, 1861. On November 23 there was a near
panic caused by rumours of British intervention. These were
denounced as false and in five days the price was back above its
previous <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_9"></a>[V2:pg
9]</span> figure. Then on November 27 came the news of the
<i>Trent</i> and the market was thrown into confusion, not because
of hopes that cotton would come more freely but in fear that war
with America would cause it to do so. The Liverpool speculators
breathed freely again only when peace was assured. This speculative
British interest was no cause for serious governmental concern and
could not affect policy. But the manufacturing trade was,
presumably, a more serious anxiety and if cotton became hard, or
even impossible to obtain, a serious situation would demand
consideration.</p>
<p>In the generally accepted view of a "short war," there was at
first no great anticipation of real danger. But beginning with
December, 1861, there was almost complete stoppage of supply from
America. In the six months to the end of May, 1862, but 11,500
bales were received, less than one per cent. of the amount for the
same six months of the previous year<a name=
"FNanchor673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673">[673]</a>. The blockade
was making itself felt and not merely in shipments from the South
but in prospects of Southern production, for the news came that the
negroes were being withdrawn by their masters from the rich sea
islands along the coast in fear of their capture by the Northern
blockading squadrons<a name="FNanchor674"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_674">[674]</a>. Such a situation seemed bound in the end
to result in pressure by the manufacturers for governmental action
to secure cotton. That it did not immediately do so is explained by
Arnold, whose dictum has been quite generally accepted, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The immediate result of the American war was, at this
time, to relieve the English cotton trade, including the dealers in
the raw material and the producers and dealers in manufactures,
from a serious and impending difficulty. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_10"></a>[V2:pg 10]</span> They had in hand
a stock of goods sufficient for the consumption of two-thirds of a
year, therefore a rise in the price of the raw material and the
partial closing of their establishments, with a curtailment of
their working expenses, was obviously to their advantage. But to
make their success complete, this rise in the price of cotton was
upon the largest stock ever collected in the country at this
season. To the cotton trade there came in these days an unlooked
for accession of wealth, such as even it had never known before. In
place of the hard times which had been anticipated, and perhaps
deserved, there came a shower of riches<a name=
"FNanchor675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675">[675]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was written of the situation in December, 1861. A similar
analysis, no doubt on the explanations offered by his English
friends, of "the question of cotton supply, which we had supposed
would speedily have disturbed the level of their neutral policy"
was made by Mason in March, 1862. "Thus," he concluded, "it is that
even in Lancashire and other manufacturing districts no open
demonstration has been made against the blockade<a name=
"FNanchor676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676">[676]</a>." Manufactures
other than cotton were greatly prospering, in particular those of
woollen, flax, and iron. And the theory that the cotton lords were
not, in reality, hit by the blockade--perhaps profited by it--was
bruited even during the war. <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, October,
1864, held this view, while the <i>Morning Post</i> of May 16,
1864, went to the extent of describing the "glut" of goods in 1861,
relieved just in the nick of time by the War, preventing a
financial crash, "which must sooner or later have caused great
suffering in Lancashire."</p>
<p>Arnold's generalization has been taken to prove that the
<i>immediate</i> effect of the Civil War was to save the cotton
industry from great disaster and that there <i>immediately</i>
resulted large profits to the manufacturers from the increased
price of stocks on hand. In fact his description of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_11"></a>[V2:pg 11]</span>
situation in December, 1861, as his own later pages show, was not
applicable, so far as manufacturers' profits are concerned, until
the later months of 1862 and the first of 1863. For though prices
might be put up, as they were, goods were not sold in any large
quantities before the fall of 1862. There were almost no
transactions for shipments to America, China, or the Indies<a name=
"FNanchor677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677">[677]</a>. Foreign
purchasers as always, and especially when their needs had just been
abundantly supplied by the great output of 1858-60, were not keen
to place new orders in a rising and uncertain market. The English
producers raised their prices, but they held their goods, lacking
an effective market. The importance of this in British foreign
policy is that at no time, until the accumulated goods were
disposed of, was there likely to be any trade eagerness for a
British intervention in America. Their only fear, says Arnold, was
the sudden opening of Southern ports and a rush of raw
cotton<a name="FNanchor678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678">[678]</a>,
a sneer called out by the alleged great losses incurred and
patriotically borne in silence. Certainly in Parliament the members
from Lancashire gave no sign of discontent with the Government
policy of neutrality for in the various debates on blockade,
mediation, and cotton supply but one Member from Lancashire,
Hopwood, ever spoke in favour of a departure from neutrality, or
referred to the distress in the manufacturing districts as due to
any other cause than the shortage in cotton caused by the
war<a name="FNanchor679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679">[679]</a>.</p>
<p>But it was far otherwise with the operatives of Lancashire.
Whatever the causes of short-time operation in the mills or of
total cessation of work the situation was such that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_12"></a>[V2:pg 12]</span> from October,
1861, more and more operatives were thrown out of employment. As
their little savings disappeared they were put upon public poor
relief or upon private charity for subsistence. The governmental
statistics do not cover, accurately, the relief offered by private
charity, but those of public aid well indicate the loss of
wage-earning opportunity. In the so-called "Distressed Districts"
of Lancashire and the adjoining counties it appears that poor
relief was given to 48,000 persons in normal times, out of a total
population of 2,300,000. In the first week of November, 1861, it
was 61,207, and for the first week of December, 71,593; thereafter
mounting steadily until March, 1862, when a temporary peak of
113,000 was reached. From March until the first week in June there
was a slight decrease; but from the second week of June poor relief
resumed an upward trend, increasing rapidly until December, 1862,
when it reached its highest point of 284,418. In this same first
week of December private relief, now thoroughly organized in a
great national effort, was extended to 236,000 people, making a
grand total at high tide of distress of over 550,000 persons, if
private relief was not extended to those receiving public funds.
But of this differentiation there is no surety--indeed there are
evidences of much duplication of effort in certain districts. In
general, however, these statistics do exhibit the great lack of
employment in a one-industry district heretofore enjoying unusual
prosperity<a name="FNanchor680"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_680">[680]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_13"></a>[V2:pg 13]</span>
<p>The manufacturing operative population of the district was
estimated at between 500,000 and 600,000. At the time of greatest
distress some 412,000 of these were receiving either public or
private aid, though many were working part-time in the mills or
were engaged on public enterprises set on foot to ease the crisis.
But there was no starvation and it is absurd to compare the crisis
to the Irish famine of the 'forties. This was a <i>cotton</i>
famine in the shortage of that commodity, but it was not a
<i>human</i> famine. The country, wrote John Bright, was passing
through a terrible crisis, but "our people will be kept alive by
the contributions of the country<a name="FNanchor681"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_681">[681]</a>." Nevertheless a rapid change from a
condition of adequate wage-earning to one of dependence on
charity--a change ultimately felt by the great bulk of those either
directly or indirectly dependent upon the cotton industry--might
have been expected to arouse popular demonstrations to force
governmental action directed to securing cotton that trade might
revive. That no such popular effect was made demands careful
analysis--to be offered in a later chapter--but here the
<i>fact</i> is alone important, and the fact was that the
operatives sympathized with the North and put no pressure on the
Cabinet. Thus at no time during the war was there any attempt from
Lancashire, whether of manufacturers or operatives, to force a
change of governmental policy<a name="FNanchor682"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_682">[682]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_14"></a>[V2:pg 14]</span>
<p>As the lack of employment developed in Lancashire public
discussion and consideration were inevitably aroused. But there was
little talk of governmental interference and such as did appear was
promptly met with opposition by the leading trade journals. July
13, 1861, the <i>Economist</i> viewed the cotton shortage as "a
<i>temporary</i> and an <i>immediate</i> one.... We have--on our
hypothesis--to provide against the stoppage of our supply for
<i>one</i> year, and that the very <i>next</i> year." Would it
<i>pay</i>, asked Bright, to break the blockade? "I don't think
myself it would be cheap ... at the cost of a war with the United
States<a name="FNanchor683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683">[683]</a>."
This was also the notion of the London <i>Shipping Gazette</i>
which, while acknowledging that the mill-owners of England and
France were about to be greatly embarrassed, continued: "<i>But we
are not going to add to the difficulty by involving ourselves in a
naval war with the Northern States</i><a name=
"FNanchor684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684">[684]</a>...." The
<i>Times</i> commented in substance in several issues in September,
1861, on the "wise policy of working short-time <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_15"></a>[V2:pg 15]</span> as a precaution
against the contingencies of the cotton supply, and of the glutted
state of distant markets for manufactured goods<a name=
"FNanchor685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685">[685]</a>." October 12,
the <i>Economist</i> acknowledged that the impatience of some
mill-owners was quite understandable as was talk of a European
compulsion on America to stop an "objectless and hopeless" quarrel,
but then entered upon an elaborate discussion of the principles
involved and demonstrated why England ought not to intervene. In
November Bright could write: "The notion of getting cotton by
interfering with the blockade is abandoned apparently by the
simpletons who once entertained it, and it is accepted now as a
fixed policy that we are to take no part in your
difficulties<a name="FNanchor686"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_686">[686]</a>." Throughout the fall of 1861 the
<i>Economist</i> was doing its best to quiet apprehensions, urging
that due to the "glut" of manufactured goods short-time must have
ensued anyway, pointing out that now an advanced price was
possible, and arguing that here was a situation likely to result in
the development of other sources of supply with an escape from the
former dependence on America. In view of the actual conditions of
the trade, already recounted, these were appealing arguments to the
larger manufacturers, but the small mills, running on short order
supplies and with few stocks of goods on hand were less easily
convinced. They were, however, without parliamentary influence and
hence negligible as affecting public policy. At the opening of the
new year, 1862, Bright declared that "with the spinners and
manufacturers and merchants, I think generally there is no wish for
any <i>immediate</i> change<a name="FNanchor687"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_687">[687]</a>."</p>
<p>Bright's letter of November, 1861, was written before news of
the <i>Trent</i> reached England: that of January, 1862, just after
that controversy had been amicably settled. The <i>Trent</i> had
both diverted attention from cotton and in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_16"></a>[V2:pg 16]</span> its immediate
result created a general determination to preserve neutrality. It
is evident that even without this threat of war there was no real
cotton pressure upon the Government. With Northern successes in the
spring of 1862 hopes were aroused that the war would soon end or
that at least some cotton districts would be captured to the relief
of England. Seward held out big promises based on the capture of
New Orleans, and these for a time calmed governmental
apprehensions, though by midsummer it was clear that the inability
to secure the country back of the city, together with the Southern
determination to burn their cotton rather than see it fall into the
hands of the enemy, would prevent any great supply from the
Mississippi valley<a name="FNanchor688"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_688">[688]</a>. This was still not a matter of
<i>immediate</i> concern, for the Government and the manufacturers
both held the opinion that it was not lack of cotton alone that was
responsible for the distress and the manufacturers were just
beginning to unload their stocks<a name="FNanchor689"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_689">[689]</a>. But in considering and judging the
attitude of the British public on this question of cotton it should
always be remembered that the great mass of the people sincerely
believed that America was responsible for the distress in
Lancashire. The error in understanding was more important than the
truth.</p>
<p>In judging governmental policy, however, the truth as regards
the causes of distress in England is the more important element.
The "Cotton Lords" did not choose to reveal it. One must believe
that they intentionally dwelt upon the war as the sole responsible
cause. In the first important parliamentary debate on cotton, May
9, 1862, not a word <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_17"></a>[V2:pg 17]</span> was said of any other element in
the situation, and, it is to be noted, not a word advocating a
change in British neutral policy<a name="FNanchor690"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_690">[690]</a>. It is to be noted also that this debate
occurred when for two months past, the numbers on poor relief in
Lancashire were temporarily decreasing<a name=
"FNanchor691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691">[691]</a>, and the
general tone of the speakers was that while the distress was
serious it was not beyond the power of the local communities to
meet it. There was not, then, in May, any reason for grave concern
and Russell expressed governmental conviction when he wrote to
Gladstone, May 18, "We must, I believe, get thro' the cotton crisis
as we can, and promote inland works and railroads in India<a name=
"FNanchor692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692">[692]</a>." Moreover the
Southern orders to destroy cotton rather than permit its capture
and export by the North disagreeably affected British
officials<a name="FNanchor693"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_693">[693]</a>. Up to the end of August, 1862, Russell,
while writing much to Lyons on England's necessity for cotton, did
not do so in a vein indicative of criticism of Northern policy nor
in the sense that British distress demanded special official
consideration. Such demands on America as were made up to this time
came wholly from France<a name="FNanchor694"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_694">[694]</a>.</p>
<p>It was not then cotton, primarily, which brought a revival in
July of the Southern attack on the Government through
Parliament<a name="FNanchor695"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_695">[695]</a>. June had seen the collapse of Lindsay's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_18"></a>[V2:pg 18]</span>
initial move, and Palmerston's answer to Hopwood, June 13, that
there was no intention, at present, to offer mediation, appeared
final. It was not cotton, but McClellan's defeat, that produced a
quick renewal of Lindsay's activities. June 30, Hopwood had
withdrawn his motion favouring recognition but in doing so asked
whether, "considering the great and increasing distress in the
country, the patient manner in which it has hitherto been borne,
and the hopelessness of the termination of hostilities, the
Government intend to take any steps whatever, either as parties to
intervention or otherwise, to endeavour to put an end to the Civil
War in America?" This was differently worded, yet contained little
variation from his former question of June 13, and this time
Palmerston replied briefly that the Government certainly would like
to mediate if it saw any hope of success but that at present "both
parties would probably reject it. If a different situation should
arise the Government would be glad to act<a name=
"FNanchor696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696">[696]</a>." This
admission was now seized upon by Lindsay who, on July 11,
introduced a motion demanding consideration of "the propriety of
offering mediation with the view of terminating hostilities," and
insisted upon a debate.</p>
<p>Thus while the first week of June seemed to have quieted rumours
of British mediation, the end of the month saw them revived. Adams
was keenly aware of the changing temper of opinion and on June 20
presented to Russell a strong representation by Seward who wrote
"under the President's instructions" that such recurrent rumours
were highly injurious to the North since upon hopes of foreign aid
the South has been encouraged and sustained from the first day of
secession. Having developed this complaint at some length Seward
went on to a brief threat, containing the real meat of the
despatch, that if foreign nations did venture to intervene or
mediate in favour of the South, the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_19"></a>[V2:pg 19]</span> North would be forced to have
recourse to a weapon hitherto not used, namely to aid in a rising
of the slaves against their masters. This was clearly a threat of a
"servile war" if Great Britain aided the South--a war which would
place Britain in a very uncomfortable position in view of her
anti-slavery sentiments in the past. It is evidence of Adams'
discretion that this despatch, written May 28, was held back from
presentation to Russell until revived rumours of mediation made the
American Minister anxious<a name="FNanchor697"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_697">[697]</a>. No answer was given by Russell for over
a month, a fact in itself indicative of some hesitancy on policy.
Soon the indirect diplomacy of Napoleon III was renewed in the hope
of British concurrence. July 11, Slidell informed Mason that
Persigny in conversation had assured him "that this Government is
now more anxious than ever to take prompt and decided action in our
favour." Slidell asked if it was impossible to stir Parliament but
acknowledged that everything depended on Palmerston: "that august
body seems to be as afraid of him as the urchins of a village
school of the birch of their pedagogue<a name=
"FNanchor698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698">[698]</a>."</p>
<p>Unquestionably Persigny here gave Slidell a hint of private
instructions now being sent by Napoleon to Thouvenel who was on a
visit to London. The Emperor telegraphed "Demandez au gouvernement
anglais s'il ne croit pas le moment venu de reconna&icirc;tre le
Sud<a name="FNanchor699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699">[699]</a>."
Palmerston had already answered this question in Parliament and
Thouvenel was personally very much opposed to the Emperor's
suggestion. There were press rumours that he was in London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_20"></a>[V2:pg 20]</span> to
bring the matter to a head, but his report to Mercier was that
interference in America was a very dangerous matter and that he
would have been "badly received" by Palmerston and Russell if he
had suggested any change in neutral policy<a name=
"FNanchor700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700">[700]</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of this decided opposition by the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs it is evident that one ground for renewed Southern
hopes was the knowledge of the Emperor's private desires. Lindsay
chose his time well for on July 16 the first thorough report on
Lancashire was laid before Parliament<a name=
"FNanchor701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701">[701]</a>, revealing an
extremity of distress not previously officially authenticated, and
during this week the papers were full of an impending disaster to
McClellan's army. Lyons, now in London, on his vacation trip, was
concerned for the future mainly because of cotton, but did not
believe there was much danger of an immediate clash with
America<a name="FNanchor702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702">[702]</a>.
But the great Southern argument of the moment was the Northern
military failure, the ability of the South to resist indefinitely
and the hopelessness of the war. On the morning of July 18 all
London was in excitement over press statements that the latest news
from America was not of McClellan's retreat but of the capture of
his entire army.</p>
<p>Lindsay's motion was set for debate on this same July 18. Adams
thought the story of McClellan's surrender had been set afloat "to
carry the House of Commons off <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_21"></a>[V2:pg 21]</span> their feet in its debate
to-night<a name="FNanchor703"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_703">[703]</a>." The debate itself may be regarded as a
serious attempt to push the Ministry into a position more
favourable to the South, and the arguments advanced surveyed the
entire ground of the causes of secession and the inevitability of
the final separation of North and South. They need but brief
summary. Lindsay, refusing to accede to appeals for postponement
because "the South was winning anyway," argued that slavery was no
element in the conflict, that the Southern cause was just, and that
England, because of her own difficulties, should mediate and bring
to a conclusion a hopeless war. He claimed the time was opportune
since mediation would be welcomed by a great majority in the North,
and he quoted from a letter by a labouring man in Lancashire,
stating, "We think it high time to give the Southern States the
recognition they so richly deserve."</p>
<p>Other pro-Southern speakers emphasized Lancashire distress.
Gregory said: "We should remember what is impending over
Lancashire--what want, what woe, what humiliation--and that not
caused by the decree of God, but by the perversity of man. I leave
the statistics of the pauperism that is, and that is to be, to my
honourable friends, the representatives of manufacturing England."
No statistics were forthcoming from this quarter for not a
representative from Lancashire participated in the debate save
Hopwood who at the very end upbraided his fellow members from the
district for their silence and was interrupted by cries of "Divide,
Divide." Lindsay's quoted letter was met by opponents of mediation
with the assertion that the operatives were well known to be united
against <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_22"></a>[V2:pg
22]</span> any action and that they could be sustained "in luxury"
from the public purse for far less a cost than that of a war with
America.</p>
<p>But cotton did not play the part expected of it in this debate.
Forster in a very able speech cleverly keeping close to a
consideration of the effect of mediation on <i>England</i>,
advanced the idea that such a step would not end the war but would
merely intensify it and so prolong English commercial distress. He
did state, however, that intervention (as distinct from mediation)
would bring on a "servile war" in America, thus giving evidence of
his close touch with Adams and his knowledge of Seward's despatch
of May 28. In the main the friends of the North were content to be
silent and leave it to the Government to answer Lindsay. This was
good tactics and they were no doubt encouraged to silence by
evidence early given in the debate that there would be no positive
result from the motion. Gregory showed that this was a real
<i>attack</i> on the Government by his bitter criticisms of
Russell's "three months" speech<a name="FNanchor704"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_704">[704]</a>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Gregory's speech Lindsay and his friends,
their immediate purpose accomplished and fearing a vote, wished to
adjourn the debate indefinitely. Palmerston objected. He agreed
that everyone earnestly wished the war in America to end, but he
declared that such debates were a great mistake unless something
definite was to follow since they only served to create irritation
in America, both North and South. He concluded with a vigorous
assertion that if the Ministry were to administer the affairs of
the nation it ought to be trusted in foreign affairs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_23"></a>[V2:pg 23]</span> not
have its hands tied by parliamentary expressions of opinion at
inopportune moments. Finally, the South had not yet securely
established its independence and hence could not be recognized.
This motion, if carried, would place England on a definite side and
thus be fatal to any hope of successful mediation or intervention
in the future. Having now made clear the policy of the Government
Palmerston did not insist upon a division and the motion was
withdrawn<a name="FNanchor705"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_705">[705]</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface Lindsay's effort of July 18 had resulted in
ignominious failure. Lyons called it "ill-timed.... I do not think
we know here sufficiently the extent of the disaster [to McClellan]
to be able to come to any conclusion as to what the European Powers
should do." But the impression left by the debate that there was a
strong parliamentary opinion in favour of mediation made Lyons add:
"I suppose Mercier will open full cry on the scent, and be all for
mediation. I am still afraid of any attempt of the kind<a name=
"FNanchor706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706">[706]</a>." Very much the
same opinion was held by Henry Adams who wrote, "the pinch has
again passed by for the moment and we breathe more freely. But I
think I wrote to you some time ago that if July found us still in
Virginia, we could no longer escape interference. I think now that
it is inevitable." A definite stand taken by the North on slavery
would bring "the greatest strength in this running battle<a name=
"FNanchor707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707">[707]</a>."</p>
<p>In spite of surface appearances that the debate was "ill-timed"
the "pinch" was not in fact passed as the activities of Slidell and
Mason and their friends soon indicated. For a fortnight the
Cabinet, reacting to the repeated suggestions of Napoleon, the
Northern defeats, and the distress in Lancashire, was seriously
considering the possibility of taking some step toward mediation.
On July 16, two days before the debate in the Commons, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_24"></a>[V2:pg 24]</span> Slidell at last
had his first personal contact with Napoleon, and came away from
the interview with the conviction that "if England long persists in
her inaction he [Napoleon] would be disposed to act without her."
This was communicated to Mason on July 20<a name=
"FNanchor708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708">[708]</a>, but Slidell
did <i>not</i> as yet see fit to reveal to Mason that in the
interview with Napoleon he had made a definite push for separate
action by France, offering inducements on cotton, a special
commercial treaty, and "alliances, defensive, and offensive, for
Mexican affairs," this last without any authority from Benjamin,
the Confederate Secretary of State. On July 23 Slidell made a
similar offer to Thouvenel and left with him a full memorandum of
the Southern proposal<a name="FNanchor709"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_709">[709]</a>. He was cautioned that it was undesirable
his special offer to France should reach the ears of the British
Government--a caution which he transmitted to Mason on July 30,
when sending copies of Benjamin's instructions, but still without
revealing the full extent of his own overtures to Napoleon.</p>

<b>JOHN SLIDELL</b><br>
(<i>From Nicolay and Hay's "Life of Abraham Lincoln": The Century

<br>
<p>In all this Slidell was still exhibiting that hankering to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_25"></a>[V2:pg 25]</span> pull
off a special diplomatic achievement, characteristic of the man,
and in line, also, with a persistent theory that the policy most
likely to secure results was that of inducing France to act alone.
But he was repeatedly running against advice that France must
follow Great Britain, and the burden of his July 20 letter to Mason
was an urging that a demand for recognition be now made
simultaneously in Paris and London. Thouvenel, not at all
enthusiastic over Slidell's proposals, told him that this was at
least a prerequisite, and on July 23, Slidell wrote Mason the
demand should be made at once<a name="FNanchor710"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_710">[710]</a>. Mason, on the advice of Lindsay,
Fitzgerald, and Lord Malmesbury, had already prepared a request for
recognition, but had deferred making it after listening to the
debate of July 18<a name="FNanchor711"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_711">[711]</a>. Now, on July 24, he addressed Russell
referring to their interview of February, 1862, in which he had
urged the claims of the Confederacy to recognition and again
presented them, asserting that the subsequent failure of Northern
campaigns had demonstrated the power of the South to maintain its
independence. The South, he wrote, asked neither aid nor
intervention; it merely desired recognition and continuation of
British neutrality<a name="FNanchor712"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_712">[712]</a>. On the same day Mason also asked for an
interview<a name="FNanchor713"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_713">[713]</a>, but received no reply until July 31,
when Russell wrote that no definite answer could be sent until
"after a Cabinet" and that an interview did not seem
necessary<a name="FNanchor714"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_714">[714]</a>.</p>
<p>This answer clearly indicates that the Government was in
uncertainty. It is significant that Russell took this moment to
reply at last to Seward's protestations of May 28<a name=
"FNanchor715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715">[715]</a>, which had been
presented to him by Adams on June 20. He instructed Stuart at
Washington that his delay had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_26"></a>[V2:pg 26]</span> been due to a "waiting for
military events," but that these had been indecisive. He gave a
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of all the sins of the North as a belligerent
and wrote in a distinctly captious spirit. Yet these sins had not
"induced Her Majesty's Government to swerve an inch from an
impartial neutrality<a name="FNanchor716"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_716">[716]</a>." Here was no promise of a continuance of
neutrality--rather a hint of some coming change. At least one
member of the Cabinet was very ready for it. Gladstone wrote
privately:</p>
<blockquote>"It is indeed much to be desired that this bloody and
purposeless conflict should cease. From the first it has been plain
enough that the whole question was whether the South was earnest
and united. That has now for some months been demonstrated; and the
fact thus established at once places the question beyond the region
even of the most brilliant military successes<a name=
"FNanchor717"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_717">[717]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>Gladstone was primarily influenced by the British commercial
situation. Lyons, still in England, and a consistent opponent of a
change of policy, feared this commercial influence. He wrote to
Stuart:</p>
<blockquote>"...I can hardly anticipate any circumstances under
which I should think the intervention of England in the quarrel
between the North and South advisable....<br>
<br>
"But it is very unfortunate that no result whatever is apparent
from the nominal re-opening of New Orleans and other ports. And the
distress in the manufacturing districts threatens to be so great
that a pressure may be put upon the Government which they will find
it difficult to resist<a name="FNanchor718"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_718">[718]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In Parliament sneers were indulged in by Palmerston at the
expense of the silent cotton manufacturers of Lancashire, much to
the fury of Cobden<a name="FNanchor719"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_719">[719]</a>. Of this period Arnold <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_27"></a>[V2:pg 27]</span> later
sarcastically remarked that, "The representatives of Lancashire in
the Houses of Parliament did not permit the gaieties of the
Exhibition season wholly to divert their attention from the
distress which prevailed in the home county<a name=
"FNanchor720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720">[720]</a>."</p>
<p>Being refused an interview, Mason transmitted to Russell on
August 1 a long appeal, rather than a demand, for recognition,
using exactly those arguments advanced by Lindsay in debate<a name=
"FNanchor721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721">[721]</a>. The answer,
evidently given after that "Cabinet" for whose decision Russell had
been waiting, was dated August 2. In it Russell, as in his reply to
Seward on July 28, called attention to the wholly contradictory
statements of North and South on the status of the war, which, in
British opinion, had not yet reached a stage positively indicative
of the permanence of Southern independence. Great Britain,
therefore, still "waited," but the time might come when Southern
firmness in resistance would bring recognition<a name=
"FNanchor722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722">[722]</a>. The tone was
more friendly than any expressions hitherto used by Russell to
Southern representatives. The reply does not reveal the decision
actually arrived at by the Ministry. Gladstone wrote to Argyll on
August 3 that "yesterday" a Cabinet had been held on the question
"to move or not to move, in the matter of the American Civil
War...." He had come away before a decision when it became evident
the prevailing sentiment would be "nothing shall be done until both
parties are desirous of it." Gladstone thought this very foolish;
he would have England approach France and Russia, but if they were
not ready, wait until they were. "Something, I trust, will be done
before the hot weather is over to stop these frightful
horrors<a name="FNanchor723"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_723">[723]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_28"></a>[V2:pg 28]</span>
<p>All parties had been waiting since the debate of July 18 for the
Cabinet decision. It was at once generally known as "no step at
present" and wisdom would have decreed quiet acquiescence.
Apparently one Southern friend, on his own initiative, felt the
need to splutter. On the next day, August 4, Lord Campbell in the
Lords moved for the production of Russell's correspondence with
Mason, making a very confused speech. "Society and Parliament" were
convinced the war ought to end in separation. At one time Campbell
argued that reconquest of the South was impossible; at another that
England should interfere to prevent such reconquest. Again he urged
that the North was in a situation where she could not stop the war
without aid from Europe in extricating her. Probably the motion was
made merely to draw from Russell an official statement. Production
of the papers was refused. Russell stated that the Government still
maintained its policy of strict neutrality, that if any action was
to be taken it should be by all the maritime powers and that if, in
the parliamentary recess, any new policy seemed advisable he would
first communicate with those powers. He also declared very
positively that as yet no proposal had been received from any
foreign power in regard to America, laying stress upon the "perfect
accord" between Great Britain and France<a name=
"FNanchor724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724">[724]</a>.</p>
<p>Mason commented on this speech that someone was evidently lying
and naturally believed that someone to be Russell. He hoped that
France would promptly make this clear<a name=
"FNanchor725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725">[725]</a>. But France
gave no sign of lack of "perfect accord." On the contrary Thouvenel
even discouraged Slidell from following Mason's example of
demanding recognition and the formal communication was withheld,
Mason acquiescing<a name="FNanchor726"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_726">[726]</a>. Slidell thought new disturbances in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_29"></a>[V2:pg 29]</span>
Italy responsible for this sudden lessening of French interest in
the South, but he was gloomy, seeing again the frustration of high
hopes. August 24 he wrote Benjamin:</p>
<blockquote>"You will find by my official correspondence that we
are still hard and fast aground here. Nothing will float us off but
a strong and continued current of important successes in the
field.<br>
<br>
I have no hope from England, because I am satisfied that she
desires an indefinite prolongation of the war, until the North
shall be entirely exhausted and broken down.<br>
<br>
Nothing can exceed the selfishness of English statesmen except
their wretched hypocrisy. They are continually casting about their
disinterested magnaminity and objection of all other considerations
than those dictated by a high-toned morality, while their entire
policy is marked by egotism and duplicity. I am getting to be
heartily tired of Paris<a name="FNanchor727"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_727">[727]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On August 7 Parliament adjourned, having passed on the last day
of the session an Act for the relief of the distress in Lancashire
by authorizing an extension of powers to the Poor Law Guardians.
Like Slidell and Mason pro-Northern circles in London thought that
in August there had come to a disastrous end the Southern push for
a change in British policy, and were jubilant. To be sure, Russell
had merely declared that the time for action was "not yet" come,
but this was regarded as a sop thrown to the South. Neither in
informed Southern nor Northern circles outside the Cabinet was
there any suspicion, <i>except by Adams</i>, that in the six months
elapsed since Lindsay had begun his movement the Ministry had been
slowly progressing in thoughts of mediation.</p>
<p>In fact the sentiment of the Cabinet as stated by Gladstone had
been <i>favourable</i> to mediation when "both parties were ready
for it" and that such readiness would come soon most Members were
convinced. This was a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_30"></a>[V2:pg 30]</span> convenient and reasonable ground
for postponing action but did not imply that if the conviction were
unrealized no mediation would be attempted. McClellan, driven out
of the Peninsula, had been removed, and August saw the Northern
army pressed back from Virginia soil. It was now Washington and not
Richmond that seemed in danger of capture. Surely the North must
soon realize the futility of further effort, and the reports early
in July from Washington dilated upon the rapid emergence of a
strong peace party.</p>
<p>But the first panic of dismay once past Stuart sent word of
enormous new Northern levies of men and of renewed courage<a name=
"FNanchor728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728">[728]</a>. By mid-August,
writing of cotton, he thought the prospect of obtaining any
quantity of it "seems hopeless," and at the same time reported the
peace party fast losing ground in the face of the great energy of
the Administration<a name="FNanchor729"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_729">[729]</a>. As to recognition, Stuart believed:
"There is nothing to be done in the presence of these enormous
fresh levies, but to wait and see what the next two months will
bring forth<a name="FNanchor730"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_730">[730]</a>." The hopes of the British Ministry based
on a supposed Northern weariness of the war were being shattered.
Argyll, having received from Sumner a letter describing the
enthusiasm and determination of the North, wrote to Gladstone:</p>
<blockquote>"It is evident, whatever may be our opinion of the
prospects of 'the North' that they do not yet, at least, feel any
approach to such exhaustion as will lead them to admit of
mediation<a name="FNanchor731"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_731">[731]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>To this Gladstone replied:</p>
<blockquote>"I agree that this is not a state of mind favourable to
mediation; and I admit it to be a matter of great difficulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_31"></a>[V2:pg 31]</span> to
determine when the first step ought to be taken; but I cannot
subscribe to the opinion of those who think that Europe is to stand
silent without limit of time and witness these horrors and
absurdities, which will soon have consumed more men, and done ten
times more mischief than the Crimean War; but with the difference
that there the end was uncertain, here it is certain in the opinion
of the whole world except one of the parties. I should be puzzled
to point out a single case of dismemberment which has been settled
by the voluntary concession of the stronger party without any
interference or warning from third powers, and as far as principle
goes there never was a case in which warning was so proper and
becoming, because of the frightful misery which this civil conflict
has brought upon other countries, and because of the unanimity with
which it is condemned by the civilized world<a name=
"FNanchor732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732">[732]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The renewal of Northern energy, first reports of which were
known to Russell early in August, came as a surprise to the British
Ministry. Their progress toward mediation had been slow but steady.
Lindsay's initial steps, resented as an effort in indirect
diplomacy and not supported by France officially, had received
prompt rejection accompanied by no indication of a desire to depart
from strict neutrality. With the cessation in late June of the
Northern victorious progress in arms and in the face of increasing
distress in Lancashire, the second answer to Lindsay was less
dogmatic. As given by Palmerston the Government desired to offer
mediation, but saw no present hope of doing so successfully.
Finally the Government asked for a free hand, making no pledges.
Mason might be gloomy, Adams exultant, but when August dawned plans
were already on foot for a decided change. The secret was well
kept. Four days after the Cabinet decision to wait on events, two
days after Russell's refusal to produce the correspondence with
Mason, Russell, on the eve of departure for the Continent, was
writing to Palmerston:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_32"></a>[V2:pg 32]</span>
<blockquote>"Mercier's notion that we should make some move in
October agrees very well with yours. I shall be back in England
before October, and we could then have a Cabinet upon it. Of course
the war may flag before that.<br>
<br>
"I quite agree with you that a proposal for an armistice should be
the first step; but we must be prepared to answer the question on
what basis are we to negotiate<a name="FNanchor733"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_733">[733]</a>?"</blockquote>
<p>The next movement to put an end to the war in America was to
come, not from Napoleon III, nor from the British friends of the
South, but from the British Ministry itself.</p>

not appear in his reports until 1864. The <i>Summary</i>
consistently includes Liverpool, and fluctuates violently for that
city whenever weather conditions interfered with the ordinary
business of the port. It is a striking illustration of the narrow
margin of living wages among the dockers of Liverpool that an
annotation at the foot of a column of statistics should explain an
increase in one week of 21,000 persons thrown on poor relief to the
"prevalence of a strong east wind" which prevented vessels from
getting up to the docks.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_682"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor682">[682]</a> The historians who see only economic
causes have misinterpreted the effects on policy of the "cotton
famine." Recently, also, there has been advanced an argument that
"wheat defeated cotton"--an idea put forward indeed in England
itself during the war by pro-Northern friends who pointed to the
great flow of wheat from the North as essential in a short-crop
situation in Great Britain. Mr. Schmidt in "The Influence of Wheat
and Cotton on Anglo-American Relations during the Civil War," a
paper read before the American Historical Association, Dec. 1917,
and since published in the <i>Iowa Journal of History and
Politics</i>, July, 1918, presents with much care all the important
statistics for both commodities, but his conclusions seem to me
wholly erroneous. He states that "Great Britain's dependence on
Northern wheat ... operated as a contributing influence in keeping
the British government officially neutral ..." (p. 423), a cautious
statement soon transformed to the positive one that "this fact did
not escape the attention of the English government," since leading
journals referred to it (p. 431). Progressively, it is asserted:
"But it was Northern wheat that may well be regarded as the
decisive factor, counterbalancing the influence of cotton, in
keeping the British government from recognizing the Confederacy"
(p. 437). "That the wheat situation must have exerted a profound
influence on the government ..." (p. 438). And finally: "In this
contest wheat won, demonstrating its importance as a world power of
greater significance than cotton" (p. 439). This interesting thesis
has been accepted by William Trimble in "Historical Aspects of the
Surplus Food Production of the United States, 1862-1902" (<i>Am.
Hist. Assoc. Reports</i>, 1918, Vol. I, p. 224). I think Mr.
Schmidt's errors are: (1) a mistake as to the time when recognition
of the South was in governmental consideration. He places it in
midsummer, 1863, when in fact the danger had passed by January of
that year. (2) A mistake in placing cotton and wheat supply on a
parity, since the former could not be obtained in quantity from
<i>any</i> source before 1864, while wheat, though coming from the
United States, could have been obtained from interior Russia, as
well as from the maritime provinces, in increased supply if Britain
had been willing to pay the added price of inland transport. There
was a real "famine" of cotton; there would have been none of wheat,
merely a higher cost. (This fact, a vital one in determining
influence, was brought out by George McHenry in the columns of
<i>The Index</i>, Sept. 18, 1862.) (3) The fact, in spite of all
Mr. Schmidt's suppositions, that while cotton was frequently a
subject of governmental concern in <i>memoranda</i> and in private
notes between members of the Cabinet, I have failed to find one
single case of the mention of wheat. This last seems conclusive in
negation of Mr. Schmidt's thesis.</blockquote>

July 20, wrote: "There is an important part of our conversation
that I will give you through Mr. Mann," who, apparently, was to
proceed at once to London to enlighten Mason. But the Mason Papers
show that Mann did not go to London, and that Mason was left in the
dark except in so far as he could guess at what Slidell had done by
reading Benjamin's instructions, sent to him by Slidell, on July
30. These did <i>not</i> include anything on Mexico, but made clear
the plan of a "special commercial advantage" to France. In C.F.
Adams, "A Crisis in Downing Street," p. 381, it is stated that
Benjamin's instructions were written "at the time of Mercier's
visit to Richmond"--with the inference that they were a result of
Mercier's conversation at that time. This is an error. Benjamin's
instructions were written on April 12, and were sent on April 14,
while it was not until April 16 that Mercier reached Richmond. To
some it will no doubt seem inconceivable that Benjamin should not
have informed Mercier of his plans for France, just formulated. But
here, as in Chapter IX, I prefer to accept Mercier's positive
assurances to Lyons at their face value. Lyons certainly so
accepted them and there is nothing in French documents yet
published to cast doubt on Mercier's honour, while the chronology
of the Confederate documents supports it.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>RUSSELL'S MEDIATION PLAN</h3>
<br>
<p>The adjournment of Parliament on August 7 without hint of
governmental inclination to act in the American Civil War was
accepted by most of the British public as evidence that the
Ministry had no intentions in that direction. But keen observers
were not so confident. Motley, at Vienna, was keeping close touch
with the situation in England through private correspondence. In
March, 1862, he thought that "France and England have made their
minds up to await the issue of the present campaign"--meaning
McClellan's advance on Richmond<a name="FNanchor734"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_734">[734]</a>. With the failure of that campaign he
wrote: "Thus far the English Government have resisted his
[Napoleon's] importunities. But their resistance will not last
long<a name="FNanchor735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735">[735]</a>."
Meanwhile the recently established pro-Southern weekly, <i>The
Index</i>, from its first issue, steadily insisted on the wisdom
and necessity of British action to end the war<a name=
"FNanchor736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736">[736]</a>. France was
declared rapidly to be winning the goodwill of the South at the
expense of England; the British aristocracy were appealed to on
grounds of close sympathy with a "Southern Aristocracy"; mediation,
at first objected to, in view of the more reasonable demand for
recognition, was in the end the chief object of <i>The Index</i>,
after mid-July, when simple recognition seemed impossible of
attainment<a name="FNanchor737"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_737">[737]</a>. Especially British <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_34"></a>[V2:pg 34]</span> humiliation
because of the timidity of her statesmen, was harped upon and any
public manifestation of Southern sympathy was printed in great
detail<a name="FNanchor738"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_738">[738]</a>.</p>
<p>The speculations of Motley, the persistent agitation of <i>The
Index</i> are, however, no indication that either Northern fears or
Southern hopes were based on authoritative information as to
governmental purpose. The plan now in the minds of Palmerston and
Russell and their steps in furthering it have been the subject of
much historical study and writing. It is here proposed to review
them in the light of all available important materials, both old
and new, using a chronological order and with more citation than is
customary, in the belief that such citations best tell the story of
this, the most critical period in the entire course of British
attitude toward the Civil War. Here, and here only, Great Britain
voluntarily approached the danger of becoming involved in the
American conflict<a name="FNanchor739"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_739">[739]</a>.</p>
<p>Among the few who thought the withdrawal of Lindsay's motion,
July 18, and the Prime Minister's comments did <i>not</i> indicate
safety for the North stood Adams, the American Minister. Of
Palmerston's speech he wrote the next day in his diary: "It was
cautious and wise, but enough could be gathered from it to show
that mischief to us in some shape will only be averted by the
favour of Divine Providence or <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_35"></a>[V2:pg 35]</span> our own efforts. The anxiety
attending my responsibility is only postponed<a name=
"FNanchor740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740">[740]</a>." At this very
moment Adams was much disturbed by his failure to secure
governmental seizure of a war vessel being built at Liverpool for
the South--the famous <i>Alabama</i>--which was soon completed and
put to sea but ten days later, July 29. Russell's delay in
enforcing British neutrality, as Adams saw it, in this matter,
reinforcing the latter's fears of a change in policy, had led him
to explain his alarm to Seward. On August 16 Adams received an
instruction, written August 2, outlining the exact steps to be
taken in case the feared change in British policy should occur. As
printed in the diplomatic documents later presented to Congress
this despatch is merely a very interesting if somewhat discursive
essay on the inevitability of European ruminations on the
possibility of interference to end the war and argues the unwisdom
of such interference, especially for Great Britain's own interests.
It does not read as if Seward were alarmed or, indeed, as if he had
given serious consideration to the supposed danger<a name=
"FNanchor741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741">[741]</a>. But this
conveys a very erroneous impression. An unprinted portion of the
despatch very specifically and in a very serious tone, instructs
Adams that if approached by the British Government with
propositions implying a purpose:</p>
<blockquote>"To dictate, or to mediate, or to advise, or even to
solicit or persuade, you will answer that you are forbidden to
debate, to hear, or in any way receive, entertain or transmit, any
communication of the kind.... If you are asked an opinion what
reception the President would give to such a proposition, if made
here, you will reply that you are not instructed, but you have no
reason for supposing that it would be entertained."</blockquote>
<p>This was to apply either to Great Britain alone or acting in
conjunction with other Powers. Further, if the South <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_36"></a>[V2:pg 36]</span> should be
"acknowledged" Adams was immediately to suspend his functions. "You
will perceive," wrote Seward, "that we have approached the
contemplation of that crisis with the caution which great
reluctance has inspired. But I trust that you will also have
perceived that the crisis has not appalled us<a name=
"FNanchor742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742">[742]</a>."</p>
<p>This serious and definite determination by the North to resent
any intervention by Europe makes evident that Seward and Lincoln
were fully committed to forcible resistance of foreign meddling.
Briefly, if the need arose, the North would go to war with Europe.
Adams at least now knew where he stood and could but await the
result. The instruction he held in reserve, nor was it ever
officially communicated to Russell. He did, however, state its
tenor to Forster who had contacts with the Cabinet through
Milner-Gibson and though no proof has been found that the American
determination was communicated to the Ministry, the presumption is
that this occurred<a name="FNanchor743"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_743">[743]</a>. Such communication could not have taken
place before the end of August and possibly was not then made owing
to the fact that the Cabinet was scattered in the long vacation and
that, apparently, the plan to move <i>soon</i> in the American War
was as yet unknown save to Palmerston and to Russell.</p>
<p>Russell's letter to Palmerston of August 6, sets the date of
their determination<a name="FNanchor744"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_744">[744]</a>. Meanwhile they were depending much upon
advices from Washington for the exact moment. Stuart was
suggesting, with Mercier, that October should be selected<a name=
"FNanchor745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745">[745]</a>, and continued
his urgings even though his immediate chief, Lyons, was writing to
him from London strong personal objections to any European
intervention whatever and especially any by Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746">[746]</a>. Lyons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_37"></a>[V2:pg 37]</span>
explained his objections to Russell as well, but Stuart, having
gone to the extent of consulting also with Stoeckl, the Russian
Minister at Washington, was now in favour of straight-out
recognition of the Confederacy as the better measure. This, thought
Stoeckl, was less likely to bring on war with the North than an
attempt at mediation<a name="FNanchor747"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_747">[747]</a>. Soon Stuart was able to give notice, a
full month in advance of the event, of Lincoln's plan to issue an
emancipation proclamation, postponed temporarily on the insistence
of Seward<a name="FNanchor748"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_748">[748]</a>, but he attached no importance to this,
regarding it as at best a measure of pretence intended to frighten
the South and to influence foreign governments<a name=
"FNanchor749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749">[749]</a>. Russell was
not impressed with Stuart's shift from mediation to recognition. "I
think," he wrote, "we must allow the President to spend his second
batch of 600,000 men before we can hope that he and his democracy
will listen to reason<a name="FNanchor750"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_750">[750]</a>." But this did not imply that Russell was
wavering in the idea that October would be a "ripe time." Soon he
was journeying to the Continent in attendance on the Queen and
using his leisure to perfect his great plan<a name=
"FNanchor751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751">[751]</a>.</p>
<p>Russell's first positive step was taken on September 13.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_38"></a>[V2:pg 38]</span> On
that date he wrote to Cowley in Paris instructing him to sound
Thouvenel, <i>privately</i><a name="FNanchor752"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_752">[752]</a>, and the day following he wrote to
Palmerston commenting on the news just received of the exploits of
Stonewall Jackson in Virginia, "it really looks as if he might end
the war. In October the hour will be ripe for the Cabinet<a name=
"FNanchor753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753">[753]</a>." Similar
reactions were expressed by Palmerston at the same moment and for
the same reasons. Palmerston also wrote on September 14:</p>
<blockquote>"The Federals ... got a very complete smashing ... even
Washington or Baltimore may fall into the hands of the
Confederates."<br>
<br>
<p>"If this should happen, would it not be time for us to consider
whether in such a state of things England and France might not
address the contending parties and recommend an arrangement upon
the basis of separation<a name="FNanchor754"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_754">[754]</a>?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell replied:</p>
<blockquote>"... I agree with you that the time is come for
offering mediation to the United States Government, with a view to
the recognition of the independence of the Confederates. I agree
further that, in case of failure, we ought ourselves to recognize
the Southern States as an independent State. For the purpose of
taking so important a step, I think we must have a meeting, of the
Cabinet. The 23rd or 30th would suit me for the meeting<a name=
"FNanchor755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755">[755]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The two elder statesmen being in such complete accord the result
of the unofficial overture to France was now awaited with interest.
This, considering the similar unofficial suggestions previously
made by Napoleon, was surprisingly lukewarm. Cowley reported that
he had held a long and serious conversation with Thouvenel on the
subject of mediation as instructed by Russell on the thirteenth and
found a disposition "to wait to see the result <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_39"></a>[V2:pg 39]</span> of the
elections" in the North. Mercier apparently had been writing that
Southern successes would strengthen the Northern peace party.
Thouvenel's idea was that "if the peace party gains the ascendant,"
Lincoln and Seward, both of whom were too far committed to listen
to foreign suggestions, would "probably be set aside." He also
emphasized the "serious consequences" England and France might
expect if they recognized the South.</p>
<blockquote>"I said that we might propose an armistice without
mediation, and that if the other Powers joined with us in doing so,
and let it be seen that a refusal would be followed by the
recognition of the Southern States, the certainty of such
recognition by all Europe must carry weight with it."<br>
<br>
Thouvenel saw some difficulties, especially Russia.<br>
<br>
"...the French Government had some time back sounded that of Russia
as to her joining France and England in an offer of mediation and
had been met by an almost scornful refusal...."<br>
<br>
"It appears also that there is less public pressure here for the
recognition of the South than there is in England<a name=
"FNanchor756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756">[756]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thouvenel's lack of enthusiasm might have operated as a check to
Russell had he not been aware of two circumstances causing less
weight than formerly to be attached to the opinions of the French
Secretary for Foreign Affairs. The first was the well-known
difference on American policy between Thouvenel and Napoleon III
and the well-grounded conviction that the Emperor was at any moment
ready to impose his will, if only England would give the signal.
The second circumstance was still more important. It was already
known through the French press that a sharp conflict had arisen in
the Government as to Italian policy and all signs pointed to a
reorganization of the Ministry which would exclude Thouvenel. Under
these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_40"></a>[V2:pg
40]</span> circumstances Russell could well afford to discount
Thouvenel's opinion. The extent to which he was ready to go--much
beyond either the offer of mediation, or of armistice evidently in
Cowley's mind--is shown by a letter to Gladstone, September 26.</p>
<blockquote>"I am inclined to think that October 16 may be soon
enough for a Cabinet, if I am free to communicate the views which
Palmerston and I entertain to France and Russia in the interval
between this time and the middle of next month. These views had the
offer of mediation to both parties in the first place, and in the
case of refusal by the North, to recognition of the South.
Mediation on the basis of separation and recognition accompanied by
a declaration of neutrality<a name="FNanchor757"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_757">[757]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The perfected plan, thus outlined, had resulted from a
communication to Palmerston of Cowley's report together with a
memorandum, proposed to be sent to Cowley, but again
<i>privately</i><a name="FNanchor758"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_758">[758]</a>, addressed to France alone. Russell here
also stated that he had explained his ideas to the Queen. "She only
wishes Austria, Prussia and Russia to be consulted. I said that
should be done, but we must consult France first." Also enclosed
was a letter from Stuart of September 9, reporting Mercier as just
returned from New York and convinced that if advantage were not
taken of the present time to do exactly that which was in Russell's
mind, Europe would have to wait for the "complete exhaustion" of
the North<a name="FNanchor759"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_759">[759]</a>. Russell was now at home again and the
next day Palmerston approved the plans as "excellent"; but he asked
whether it would not be well to include Russia in the invitation as
a compliment, even though "she might probably decline." As to the
other European powers the matter could wait for an "after
communication." Yet that Palmerston still wished to go <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_41"></a>[V2:pg 41]</span> slowly is shown
by a comment on the military situation in America:</p>
<blockquote>"It is evident that a great conflict is taking place to
the north-west of Washington, and its issue must have a great
effect on the state of affairs. If the Federals sustain a great
defeat, they may be at once ready for mediation, and the iron
should be struck while it is hot. If, on the other hand, they
should have the best of it, we may wait awhile and see what may
follow<a name="FNanchor760"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_760">[760]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>Thus through Palmerston's caution Russia had been added to
France in Russell's proposed memorandum and the communication to
Cowley had not been sent off immediately--as the letter to
Gladstone of September 26 indicates. But the plan was regarded as
so far determined upon that on September 24 Russell requested Lyons
not to fix, as yet, upon a date for his departure for America,
writing, "M. Mercier is again looking out for an opportunity to
offer mediation, and this time he is not so much out in his
reckoning<a name="FNanchor761"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_761">[761]</a>." Curiously Mercier had again changed his
mind and now thought a proposal of an armistice was the best move,
being "particularly anxious that there should be no mention of the
word <i>separation</i>," but of this Russell had, as yet, no
inkling<a name="FNanchor762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762">[762]</a>.
With full approval of the plan as now outlined, Palmerston wrote to
Gladstone, September 24, that he and Russell were in complete
agreement that an offer of mediation should be made by the three
maritime powers, but that "no actual step would be taken without
the sanction of the Cabinet<a name="FNanchor763"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_763">[763]</a>." Two days later Russell explained to
Gladstone the exact nature of the proposal<a name=
"FNanchor764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764">[764]</a>, but that there
was even now no thoroughly worked out agreement on the sequence of
steps necessary is shown by <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_42"></a>[V2:pg 42]</span> Palmerston's letter to Gladstone
of the twenty-fourth, in which is outlined a preliminary proposal
of an armistice, cessation of blockade, and negotiation on the
basis of separation<a name="FNanchor765"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_765">[765]</a>.</p>
<p>Other members of the Cabinet were likewise informed of the
proposed overture to France and Russia and soon it was clear that
there would be opposition. Granville had replaced Russell in
attendance upon the Queen at Gotha. He now addressed a long and
careful argument to Russell opposing the adventure, as he thought
it, summing up his opinion in this wise:</p>
<blockquote>"...I doubt, if the war continues long after our
recognition of the South, whether it will be possible for us to
avoid drifting into it."<br>
<br>
"...I have come to the conclusion that it is premature to depart
from the policy which has hitherto been adopted by you and Lord
Palmerston, and which, notwithstanding the strong antipathy to the
North, the strong sympathy with the South, and the passionate wish
to have cotton, has met with such general approval from Parliament,
the press, and the public<a name="FNanchor766"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_766">[766]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But Granville had little hope his views would prevail. A few
days later he wrote to Lord Stanley of Alderley:</p>
<blockquote>"I have written to Johnny my reasons for thinking it
decidedly premature. I, however, suspect you will settle to do so!
Pam, Johnny, and Gladstone would be in favour of it; and probably
Newcastle. I do not know about the others. It appears to me a great
mistake<a name="FNanchor767"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_767">[767]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Opportunely giving added effect to Granville's letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_43"></a>[V2:pg 43]</span>
there now arrived confused accounts from America of the battles
about Washington and of a check to the Southern advance. On
September 17 there had been fought the battle of Antietam and two
days later Lee, giving up his Maryland campaign, began a retreat
through the Shenandoah valley toward the old defensive Southern
lines before Richmond. There was no pursuit, for McClellan, again
briefly in command, thought his army too shattered for an advance.
Palmerston had been counting on a great Southern victory and was
now doubtful whether the time had come after all for European
overtures to the contestants. October 2 he wrote Russell:</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAR RUSSELL,<br>
<br>
"I return you Granville's letter which contains much deserving of
serious consideration. There is no doubt that the offer of
Mediation upon the basis of Separation would be accepted by the
South. Why should it not be accepted? It would give the South in
principle the points for which they are fighting. The refusal, if
refusal there was, would come from the North, who would be
unwilling to give up the principle for which they have been
fighting so long as they had a reasonable expectation that by going
on fighting they could carry their point. The condition of things
therefore which would be favourable to an offer of mediation would
be great success of the South against the North. That state of
things seemed ten days ago to be approaching. Its advance has been
lately checked, but we do not yet know the real course of recent
events, and still less can we foresee what is about to follow. Ten
days or a fortnight more may throw a clearer light upon future
prospects.<br>
<br>
"As regards possible resentment on the part of the Northerns
following upon an acknowledgment of the Independence of the South,
it is quite true that we should have less to care about that
resentment in the spring when communication with Canada was open,
and when our naval force could more easily operate upon the
American coast, than in winter when we are cut off from Canada and
the American coast is not so safe.<br>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_44"></a>[V2:pg 44]</span> "But
if the acknowledgment were made at one and the same time by
England, France and some other Powers, the Yankees would probably
not seek a quarrel with us alone, and would not like one against a
European Confederation. Such a quarrel would render certain and
permanent that Southern Independence the acknowledgment of which
would have caused it.<br>
<br>
"The first communication to be made by England and France to the
contending parties might be, not an absolute offer of mediation but
a friendly suggestion whether the time was not come when it might
be well for the two parties to consider whether the war, however
long continued, could lead to any other result than separation; and
whether it might not therefore be best to avoid the great evils
which must necessarily flow from a prolongation of hostilities by
at once coming to an agreement to treat upon that principle of
separation which must apparently be the inevitable result of the
contest, however long it may last.<br>
<br>
"The best thing would be that the two parties should settle details
by direct negotiation with each other, though perhaps with the
rancorous hatred now existing between them this might be difficult.
But their quarrels in negotiation would do us no harm if they did
not lead to a renewal of war. An armistice, if not accompanied by a
cessation of blockades, would be all in favour of the North,
especially if New Orleans remained in the hands of the North.<br>
<br>
"The whole matter is full of difficulty, and can only be cleared up
by some more decided events between the contending armies...."<br>
<br>
PALMERSTON<a name="FNanchor768"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_768">[768]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Very evidently Palmerston was experiencing doubts and was all in
favour of cautious delay. American military events more than
Granville's arguments influenced him, but almost immediately there
appeared a much more vigorous and determined opponent within the
Cabinet. Cornewall Lewis was prompt to express objections. October
2, Russell transmitted to Palmerston a letter of disapproval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_45"></a>[V2:pg 45]</span> from
Lewis. Russell also, momentarily, was hesitating. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"This American question must be well sifted. I send you
a letter of G. Lewis who is against moving ..."<br>
<br>
"My only doubt is whether we and France should stir if Russia holds
back. Her separation from our move would ensure the rejection of
our proposals. But we shall know more by the 16th. I have desired a
cabinet to be summoned for that day, but the summons will not go
out till Saturday. So if you wish to stop it, write to
Hammond<a name="FNanchor769"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_769">[769]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>From this it would appear that Russia had been
approached<a name="FNanchor770"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_770">[770]</a> but that Russell's chief concern was the
attitude of France, that his proposed private communication to
Cowley had been despatched and that he was waiting an answer which
might be expected before the sixteenth. If so his expectations were
negatived by that crisis now on in the French Ministry over the
Italian question prohibiting consideration of any other matter. On
October 15 Thouvenel was dismissed, but his formal retirement from
office did not take place until October 24. Several Ministers
abroad, among them Flahault, at London, followed him into
retirement and foreign affairs were temporarily in
confusion<a name="FNanchor771"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_771">[771]</a>. The Emperor was away <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_46"></a>[V2:pg 46]</span> from Paris and
all that Cowley reported was that the last time he had seen
Thouvenel the latter had merely remarked that "as soon as the
Emperor came back the two Governments ought to enter into a serious
consideration of the whole question<a name=
"FNanchor772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772">[772]</a>...." Cowley
himself was more concerned that it was now becoming clear France,
in spite of previous protestations, was planning "colonizing"
Mexico<a name="FNanchor773"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_773">[773]</a>.</p>
<p>Up to the end of September, therefore, the British Government,
while wholly confident that France would agree in any effort
whatsoever that England might wish to make, had no recent
assurances, either official or private, to this effect. This did
not disturb Russell, who took for granted French approval, and soon
he cast aside the hesitation caused by the doubts of Granville, the
opposition of Lewis, and the caution of Palmerston. Public opinion
was certainly turning toward a demand for Ministerial
action<a name="FNanchor774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774">[774]</a>.
Two days of further consideration caused him to return to the
attack; October 4 he wrote Palmerston:</p>
<blockquote>"I think unless some miracle takes place this will be
the very time for offering mediation, or as you suggest, proposing
to North and South to come to terms.<br>
<br>
"Two things however must be made clear:<br>
<br>
(i) That we propose separation,<br>
<br>
(ii) That we shall take no part in the war unless attacked
ourselves<a name="FNanchor775"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_775">[775]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>How Russell proposed to evade a war with an angry North was not
made clear, but in this same letter notice was given that he was
preparing a memorandum for the Cabinet. Russell was still for a
mediation on lines of separation, but his uncertainty, even
confusion, of mind became evident <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_47"></a>[V2:pg 47]</span> but another two days later on
receipt of a letter from Stuart, written September 23, in which he
and Mercier were now all for a suggestion of armistice, with no
mention of separation<a name="FNanchor776"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_776">[776]</a>. Russell now thought:</p>
<blockquote>"If no fresh battles occur, I think the suggestion
might be adopted, tho' I am far from thinking with Mercier that the
North would accept it. But it would be a fair and defensible
course, leaving it open to us to hasten or defer recognition if the
proposal is declined. Lord Lyons might carry it over on the
25th<a name="FNanchor777"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_777">[777]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>British policy, as represented by the inclinations of the
Foreign Secretary, having started out on a course portending
positive and vigorous action, was now evidently in danger of
veering far to one side, if not turning completely about. But the
day after Russell seemed to be considering such an attenuation of
the earlier plan as to be content with a mere suggestion of
armistice, a bomb was thrown into the already troubled waters
further and violently disturbing them. This was Gladstone's speech
at Newcastle, October 7, a good third of which was devoted to the
Civil War and in which he asserted that Jefferson Davis had made an
army, was making a navy, and had created something still greater--a
nation<a name="FNanchor778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778">[778]</a>.
The chronology of shifts in opinion would, at first glance,
indicate that Gladstone made this speech with the intention of
forcing Palmerston and Russell to continue in the line earlier
adopted, thus hoping to bolster up a cause now losing ground. His
declaration, coming from a leading member of of the Cabinet, was
certain to be accepted by the public as a foreshadowing of
governmental action. If Jefferson Davis <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_48"></a>[V2:pg 48]</span> had in truth
created a nation then early recognition must be given it. But this
surmise of intentional pressure is not borne out by any discovered
evidence. On the contrary, the truth is, seemingly, that Gladstone,
in the north and out of touch, was in complete ignorance that the
two weeks elapsed since his letters from Palmerston and Russell had
produced any alteration of plan or even any hesitation. Himself
long convinced of the wisdom of British intervention in some form
Gladstone evidently could not resist the temptation to make the
good news known. His declaration, foreshadowing a policy that did
not pertain to his own department, and, more especially, that had
not yet received Cabinet approval was in itself an offence against
the traditions of British Cabinet organization. He had spoken
without authorization and "off his own bat."</p>
<p>The speculative market, sensitive barometer of governmental
policy, immediately underwent such violent fluctuations as to
indicate a general belief that Gladstone's speech meant action in
the war. The price of raw cotton dropped so abruptly as to alarm
Southern friends and cause them to give assurances that even if the
blockade were broken there would be no immediate outpouring of
cotton from Southern ports<a name="FNanchor779"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_779">[779]</a>. On the other hand, Bright, staunch
friend of the North, <i>hoped</i> that Gladstone was merely seeking
to overcome a half-hearted reluctance of Palmerston and Russell to
move. He was sore at heart over the "vile speech" of "your old
acquaintance and friend<a name="FNanchor780"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_780">[780]</a>." The leading newspapers while at first
accepting the Newcastle speech as an authoritative statement and
generally, though mildly, approving, were quick to feel that there
was still uncertainty of policy and became silent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_49"></a>[V2:pg 49]</span> until it should
be made clear just what was in the wind<a name=
"FNanchor781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781">[781]</a>. Within the
Cabinet it is to be supposed that Gladstone had caused no small
stir, both by reason of his unusual procedure and by his
sentiments. On Russell, however much disliked was the incursion
into his own province, the effect was reinvigoration of a desire to
carry through at least some portion of the plan and he determined
to go on with the proposal of an armistice. Six days after
Gladstone's speech Russell circulated, October 13, a memorandum on
America<a name="FNanchor782"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_782">[782]</a>.</p>
<p>This memorandum asserted that the South had shown, conclusively,
its power to resist--had maintained a successful defensive; that
the notion of a strong pro-Northern element in the South had been
shown to be wholly delusive; that the emancipation proclamation,
promising a freeing of the slaves in the sections still in
rebellion on January 1, 1863, was no humanitarian or idealistic
measure (since it left slavery in the loyal or recognized
districts) and was but an incitement to servile war--a most
"terrible" plan. For these reasons Russell urged that the Great
Powers ought seriously to consider whether it was not their duty to
propose a "suspension of arms" for the purpose of "weighing calmly
the advantages of peace<a name="FNanchor783"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_783">[783]</a>." This was a far cry from mediation and
recognition, nor did Russell <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_50"></a>[V2:pg 50]</span> indicate either the proposed terms
of an armistice or the exact steps to be taken by Europe in
bringing it about and making it of value. But the memorandum of
October 13 does clearly negative what has been the accepted British
political tradition which is to the effect that Palmerston, angered
at Gladstone's presumption and now determined against action, had
"put up" Cornewall Lewis to reply in a public speech, thereby
permitting public information that no Cabinet decision had as yet
been reached. Lewis' speech was made at Hereford on October 14.
Such were the relations between Palmerston and Russell that it is
impossible the former would have so used Lewis without notifying
Russell, in which case there would have been no Foreign Office
memorandum of the thirteenth<a name="FNanchor784"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_784">[784]</a>. Lewis was, in fact, vigorously
maintaining his objections, already made known to Russell, to
<i>any</i> plan of departure from the hitherto accepted policy of
neutrality and his speech at Hereford was the opening gun of active
opposition.</p>
<p>Lewis did not in any sense pose as a friend of the North. Rather
he treated the whole matter, in his speech at Hereford and later in
the Cabinet as one requiring cool judgment and decision on the sole
ground of British interests. This was the line best suited to
sustain his arguments, but does not prove, as some have thought,
that his Cabinet acknowledgment of the impossibility of Northern
complete victory, was his private conviction<a name=
"FNanchor785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785">[785]</a>. At Hereford
Lewis argued that everyone must acknowledge a great war was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_51"></a>[V2:pg 51]</span>
progress and must admit it "to be undecided. Under such
circumstances, the time had not yet arrived when it could be
asserted in accordance with the established doctrines of
international law that the independence of the Southern States had
been established<a name="FNanchor786"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_786">[786]</a>." In effect Lewis gave public notice that
no Cabinet decision had yet been reached, a step equally opposed to
Cabinet traditions with Gladstone's speech, since equally
unauthorized, but excusable in the view that the first offence
against tradition had forced a rejoinder<a name=
"FNanchor787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787">[787]</a>. For the public
Lewis accomplished his purpose and the press refrained from
comment, awaiting results<a name="FNanchor788"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_788">[788]</a>. Meanwhile Palmerston, who must finally
determine policy, was remaining in uncertainty and in this
situation thought it wise to consult, indirectly, Derby, the leader
of the opposition in Parliament. This was done through Clarendon,
who wrote to Palmerston on October 16 that Derby was averse to
action.</p>
<blockquote>"He said that he had been constantly urged to <i>go in
for</i> recognition and mediation, but had always refused on the
ground that recognition would merely irritate the North without
advancing the cause of the South or procuring a single bale of
cotton, and that mediation in the present temper of the
Belligerents <i>must</i> be rejected even if the mediating Powers
themselves knew what to propose as a fair basis of compromise; for
as each party insisted upon having that which the other declared
was vitally essential to its existence, it was clear that the war
had not yet marked <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_52"></a>[V2:pg 52]</span> out the stipulations of a treaty
of peace.... The recognition of the South could be of no benefit to
England unless we meant to sweep away the blockade, which would be
an act of hostility towards the North<a name=
"FNanchor789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789">[789]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>More than any other member of the Cabinet Lewis was able to
guess, fairly accurately, what was in the Premier's mind for Lewis
was Clarendon's brother-in-law, and "the most intimate and esteemed
of his male friends<a name="FNanchor790"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_790">[790]</a>." They were in constant communication as
the Cabinet crisis developed, and Lewis' next step was taken
immediately after Palmerston's consultation of Derby through
Clarendon. October 17, Lewis circulated a memorandum in reply to
that of Russell's of October 13. He agreed with Russell's statement
of the facts of the situation in America, but added with
sarcasm:</p>
<blockquote>"A dispassionate bystander might be expected to concur
in the historical view of Lord Russell, and to desire that the war
should be speedily terminated by a pacific agreement between the
contending parties. But, unhappily, the decision upon any proposal
of the English Government will be made, not by dispassionate
bystanders, but by heated and violent partisans; and we have to
consider, not how the proposal indicated in the Memorandum ought to
be received, or how it would be received by a conclave of
philosophers, but how it is likely to be received by the persons to
whom it would be addressed."</blockquote>
<p>Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, Lewis admitted, presumably
was intended to incite servile war, but that very fact was an
argument against, not for, British action, since it revealed an
intensity of bitterness prohibitory of any "calm consideration" of
issues by the belligerents. And suppose the North did acquiesce in
an armistice the only peaceful solution would be an independent
slave-holding South for the establishment of which Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_53"></a>[V2:pg 53]</span>
would have become intermediary and sponsor. Any policy except that
of the continuance of strict neutrality was full of dangers, some
evident, some but dimly visible as yet. Statesmanship required
great caution; "... looking to the probable consequences," Lewis
concluded, "of this philanthropic proposition, we may doubt whether
the chances of evil do not preponderate over the chances of good,
and whether it is not--</p>
<blockquote>'Better to endure the ills we have<br>
Than fly to others which we know not of<a name=
"FNanchor791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791">[791]</a>.'"</blockquote>
<p>At the exact time when Lewis thus voiced his objections, basing
them on the lack of any sentiment toward peace in America, there
were received at the Foreign Office and read with interest the
reports of a British special agent sent out from Washington on a
tour of the Western States. Anderson's reports emphasized three
points:</p>
<p>(1) Emancipation was purely a war measure with no thought of
ameliorating the condition of the slaves once freed;</p>
<p>(2) Even if the war should stop there was no likelihood of
securing cotton for a long time to come;</p>
<p>(3) The Western States, even more then the Eastern, were in
favour of vigorous prosecution of the war and the new call for men
was being met with enthusiasm<a name="FNanchor792"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_792">[792]</a>.</p>
<p>This was unpromising either for relief to a distressed England
or for Northern acceptance of an armistice, yet Russell, commenting
on Clarendon's letter to Palmerston, containing Derby's advice,
still argued that even if declined a suggestion of armistice could
do no harm and might open <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_54"></a>[V2:pg 54]</span> the way for a later move, but he
agreed that recognition "would certainly be premature at
present<a name="FNanchor793"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_793">[793]</a>." Russell himself now heard from
Clarendon and learned that Derby "had been constantly urged to
press for recognition and mediation but he had always refused on
the ground that the neutral policy hitherto pursued by the
Government was the right one and that if we departed from it we
should only meet with an insolent rejection of our offer<a name=
"FNanchor794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794">[794]</a>." A long
conference with Lyons gave cause for further thought and Russell
committed himself to the extent that he acknowledged "we ought not
to move <i>at present</i> without Russia<a name=
"FNanchor795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795">[795]</a>...." Finally,
October 22, Palmerston reached a decision for the immediate
present, writing to Russell:</p>
<blockquote>"Your description of the state of things between the
two parties is most comprehensive and just. I am, however, much
inclined to agree with Lewis that at present we could take no step
nor make any communication of a distinct proposition with any
advantage."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"All that we could possibly do without injury to our position would
be to ask the two Parties not whether they would agree to an
armistice but whether they might not turn their thoughts towards an
arrangement between themselves. But the answer of each might be
written by us beforehand. The Northerners would say that the only
condition of arrangement would be the restoration of the Union; the
South would say their only condition would be an acknowledgment by
the North of Southern Independence--we should not be more advanced
and should only have pledged each party more strongly to the object
for which they are fighting. I am therefore inclined to change the
opinion on which I wrote to you when the Confederates seemed to be
carrying all before them, and I am very much come back to our
original view of the matter, that we must <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_55"></a>[V2:pg 55]</span> continue merely
to be lookers-on till the war shall have taken a more decided
turn<a name="FNanchor796"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_796">[796]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>By previous arrangement the date October 23 had been set for a
Cabinet to consider the American question but Russell now postponed
it, though a few members appeared and held an informal discussion
in which Russell still justified his "armistice" policy and was
opposed by Lewis and the majority of those present. Palmerston did
not attend, no action was possible and technically no Cabinet was
held<a name="FNanchor797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797">[797]</a>. It
soon appeared that Russell, vexed at the turn matters had taken,
was reluctant in yielding and did not regard the question as
finally settled. Yet on the afternoon of this same day Adams, much
disturbed by the rumours attendant upon the speeches of Gladstone
and Lewis, sought an explanation from Russell and was informed that
the Government was not inclined at present to change its policy but
could make no promises for the future<a name=
"FNanchor798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798">[798]</a>. This appeared
to Adams to be an assurance against <i>any</i> effort by Great
Britain and has been interpreted as disingenuous on Russell's part.
Certainly Adams' confidence was restored by the interview. But
Russell was apparently unconvinced as yet that a suggestion of
armistice would necessarily lead to the evil consequences
prophesied by Lewis, or would, indeed, require any departure from a
policy of strict neutrality. On the one side Russell was being
berated by pro-Southerners as weakly continuing an outworn policy
and as having "made himself the laughing-stock of Europe and of
America<a name="FNanchor799"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_799">[799]</a>;" on the other he was regarded, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_56"></a>[V2:pg 56]</span>
moment, as insisting, through pique, on a line of action highly
dangerous to the preservation of peace with the North. October 23
Palmerston wrote his approval of the Cabinet postponement, but
declared Lewis' doctrine of "no recognition of Southern
independence until the North had admitted it" was unsound<a name=
"FNanchor800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800">[800]</a>. The next day
he again wrote: "... to talk to the belligerents about peace at
present would be as useless as asking the winds during the last
week to let the waters remain calm<a name=
"FNanchor801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801">[801]</a>."</p>
<p>This expression by Palmerston on the day after the question
apparently had come to a conclusion was the result of the
unexpected persistence of Russell and Gladstone. Replying to
Palmerston's letter of the twenty-third, Russell wrote: "As no good
could come of a Cabinet, I put it off. But tho' I am quite ready to
agree to your conclusions for the present, I cannot do so for G.
Lewis' reasons...."</p>
<blockquote>"G. Lewis besides has made a proposition for me which I
never thought of making. He says I propose that England and France
and perhaps some one Continental power should ask America to
suspend the war. I never thought of making such a proposal.<br>
<br>
"I think if Russia agreed Prussia would. And if France and England
agreed Austria would. Less than the whole five would not do. I
thought it right towards the Cabinet to reserve any specific
proposition. I am not at all inclined to adopt G. Lewis'
invention.<br>
<br>
"I have sent off Lyons without instructions, at which he is much
pleased<a name="FNanchor802"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_802">[802]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Russell was shifting ground; first the proposal was to have been
made by England and France; then Russia was <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_57"></a>[V2:pg 57]</span> necessary; now
"less than five powers would not do." But whatever the number
required he still desired a proposal of armistice. On October 23,
presumably subsequent to the informal meeting of Cabinet members,
he drew up a brief memorandum in answer to that of Lewis on October
17, denying that Lewis had correctly interpreted his plan, and
declaring that he had always had "in contemplation" a step by the
five great powers of Europe. The advisability of trying to secure
such joint action, Russell asserted, was all he had had in mind.
<i>If</i> the Cabinet had approved this advisability, and the
powers were acquiescent, <i>then</i> (in answer to Lewis'
accusation of "no look ahead") he would be ready with definite
plans for the negotiation of peace between North and South<a name=
"FNanchor803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803">[803]</a>. Thus by letter
to Palmerston and by circulation of a new memorandum Russell gave
notice that all was not yet decided. On October 24, Gladstone also
circulated a memorandum in reply to Lewis, urging action by
England, France and Russia<a name="FNanchor804"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_804">[804]</a>.</p>
<p>Russell's second memorandum was not at first taken seriously by
his Cabinet opponents. They believed the issue closed and Russell
merely putting out a denial of alleged purposes. Clarendon, though
not a member of the Cabinet, was keeping close touch with the
situation and on October 24 wrote to Lewis:</p>
<blockquote>"Thanks for sending me your memorandum on the American
question, which I have read with great satisfaction. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_58"></a>[V2:pg 58]</span> Johnny [Russell]
always loves to do something when to do nothing is prudent, and I
have no doubt that he hoped to get support in his meddling
proclivities when he called a Cabinet for yesterday; but its
postponement <i>sine die</i> is probably due to your memorandum.
You have made so clear the idiotic position we should occupy,
either in having presented our face gratuitously to the Yankee slap
we should receive, or in being asked what practical solution we had
to propose after an armistice had been agreed to at our suggestion,
that no discussion on the subject would have been possible, and the
Foreign Secretary probably thought it would be pleasanter to draw
in his horns at Woburn than in Downing Street<a name=
"FNanchor805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805">[805]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On October 26, having received from Lewis a copy of Russell's
newly-circulated paper, Clarendon wrote again:</p>
<blockquote>"The Foreign Secretary's <i>blatt</i> exhibits
considerable soreness, for which you are specially bound to make
allowance, as it was you who procured abortion for him. He had
thought to make a great deal of his colt by Meddler out of Vanity,
and you have shown his backers that the animal was not fit to start
and would not run a yard if he did. He is therefore taken back to
the country, where he must have a deal more training before he can
appear in public again."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"I should say that your speech at Hereford was nearly as effective
in checking the alarm and speculation caused by Gladstone's speech,
as your memorandum was in smashing the Foreign Secretary's proposed
intervention, and that you did so without in the smallest degree
committing either the Government or yourself with respect to the
future<a name="FNanchor806"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_806">[806]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In effect Clarendon was advising Lewis to pay no attention to
Russell's complaining rejoinder since the object desired had been
secured, but there was still one element of strength for Russell
and Gladstone which, if obtained, might easily cause a re-opening
of the whole question. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_59"></a>[V2:pg 59]</span> This was the desire of France,
still unexpressed in spite of indirect overtures, a silence in part
responsible for the expression of an opinion by Palmerston that
Napoleon's words could not be depended upon as an indication of
what he intended to do<a name="FNanchor807"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_807">[807]</a>. On the day this was written the French
ministerial crisis--the real cause of Napoleon's silence--came to
an end with the retirement of Thouvenel and the succession of
Drouyn de Lhuys. Russell's reply to Palmerston's assertion of the
folly of appealing now to the belligerents was that "recognition"
was certainly out of the question for the present and that "it
should not take place till May Or June next year, when
circumstances may show pretty clearly whether Gladstone was
right<a name="FNanchor808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808">[808]</a>."
But this yielding to the Premier's decision was quickly withdrawn
when, at last, Napoleon and his new Minister could turn their
attention to the American question.</p>
<p>On October 27 Cowley reported a conversation with the Emperor in
which American affairs were discussed. Napoleon hoped that England,
France and Russia would join in an offer of mediation. Cowley
replied that he had no instructions and Napoleon then modified his
ideas by suggesting a proposal of armistice for six months "in
order to give time for the present excitement to calm down<a name=
"FNanchor809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809">[809]</a>...." The next
day Cowley reported that Drouyn de Lhuys stated the Emperor to be
very anxious to "put an end to the War," but that he was himself
doubtful whether it would not be better to "wait a little longer,"
and in any case if overtures to America were rejected Russia
probably would not join Great Britain and France in going on to a
recognition of the South<a name="FNanchor810"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_810">[810]</a>. All this was exactly in line with that
plan to which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_60"></a>[V2:pg
60]</span> Russell had finally come and if officially notified to
the British Government would require a renewed consideration by the
Cabinet. Presumably Napoleon knew what had been going on in London
and he now hastened to give the needed French push. October 28,
Slidell was summoned to an audience and told of the Emperor's
purpose, acting with England, to bring about an armistice<a name=
"FNanchor811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811">[811]</a>. Three days
later, October 31, Cowley wrote that he had now been officially
informed by Drouyn de Lhuys, "by the Emperor's orders" that a
despatch was about to be sent to the French Ministers in England
and Russia instructing them to request joint action by the three
powers in suggesting an armistice of six months <i>including a
suspension of the blockade</i>, thus throwing open Southern ports
to European commerce<a name="FNanchor812"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_812">[812]</a>.</p>
<p>Napoleon's proposal evidently took Palmerston by surprise and
was not regarded with favour. He wrote to Russell:</p>
<blockquote>"As to the French scheme of proposals to the United
States, we had better keep that question till the Cabinet meets,
which would be either on Monday 11th, or Wednesday 12th, as would
be most convenient to you and our colleagues. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_61"></a>[V2:pg 61]</span> But is it likely
that the Federals would consent to an armistice to be accompanied
by a cessation of Blockades, and which would give the Confederates
means of getting all the supplies they may want?"<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"Then comes the difficulty about slavery and the giving up of
runaway slaves, about which we could hardly frame a proposal which
the Southerns would agree to, and people of England would approve
of. The French Government are more free from the shackles of
principle and of right and wrong on these matters, as on all others
than we are. At all events it would be wiser to wait till the
elections in North America are over before any proposal is made. As
the Emperor is so anxious to put a stop to bloodshed he might try
his hand as a beginning by putting down the stream of ruffians
which rolls out from that never-failing fountain at Rome<a name=
"FNanchor813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813">[813]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But Russell was more optimistic, or at least in favour of some
sort of proposal to America. He replied to Palmerston:</p>
<blockquote>"My notion is that as there is little chance of our
good offices being accepted in America we should make them such as
would be creditable to us in Europe. I should propose to answer the
French proposal therefore by saying,<br>
<br>
"That in offering our good offices we ought to require both parties
to consent to examine, first, whether there are any terms upon
which North and South would consent to restore the Union; and
secondly, failing any such terms, whether there are any terms upon
which both would consent to separate.<br>
<br>
"We should also say that if the Union is to be restored it would be
essential in our view, that after what has taken place all the
slaves should be emancipated, compensation being granted by
Congress at the rate at which Great Britain emancipated her slaves
in 1833.<br>
<br>
"If separation takes place we must be silent on the trend of
slavery, as we are with regard to Spain and Brazil.<br>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_62"></a>[V2:pg 62]</span>
"This is a rough sketch, but I will expand it for the Cabinet.<br>
<br>
"It will be an honourable proposal to make, but the North and
probably the South will refuse it<a name="FNanchor814"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_814">[814]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Here were several ideas quite impossible of acceptance by North
and South in their then frame of mind and Russell himself believed
them certain to be refused by the North in any case. But he was
eager to present the question for Cabinet discussion hoping for a
reversal of the previous decision. Whether from pique or from
conviction of the wisdom of a change in British policy, he proposed
to press for acceptance of the French plan, with modifications. The
news of Napoleon's offer and of Russell's attitude, with some
uncertainty as to that of Palmerston, again brought Lewis into
action and on November 7 he circulated another memorandum, this
time a very long one of some fifteen thousand words. This was in
the main an historical r&eacute;sum&eacute; of past British policy
in relation to revolted peoples, stating the international law of
such cases, and pointing out that Great Britain had never
recognized a revolted people so long as a <i>bona fide</i> struggle
was still going on. Peace was no doubt greatly to be desired. "If
England could, by legitimate means, and without unduly sacrificing
or imperilling her own interests, accelerate this consummation, she
would, in my opinion, earn the just gratitude of the civilized
world." But the question, as he had previously asserted, was full
of grave dangers. The very suggestion of a concert of Powers was
itself one to be avoided. "A conference of the five great Powers is
an imposing force, but it is a dangerous body to set in motion. A
single intervening Power may possibly contrive to satisfy both the
adverse parties; but five intervening Powers have first to satisfy
one another." Who could tell what divergence might arise on the
question <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_63"></a>[V2:pg
63]</span> of slavery, or on boundaries, or how far England might
find her ideals or her vital interests compromised<a name=
"FNanchor815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815">[815]</a>?</p>
<p>Here was vigorous resistance to Russell, especially effective
for its appeal to past British policy, and to correct practice in
international law. On the same day that Lewis' memorandum was
circulated, there appeared a communication in the <i>Times</i> by
"Historicus," on "The International Doctrine of Recognition,"
outlining in briefer form exactly those international law arguments
presented by Lewis, and advocating a continuation of the policy of
strict neutrality. "Historicus" was William Vernon Harcourt,
husband of Lewis' stepdaughter who was also the niece of Clarendon.
Evidently the family guns were all trained on Russell<a name=
"FNanchor816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816">[816]</a>. "Historicus"
drove home the fact that premature action by a neutral was a
"hostile act" and ought to be resented by the "Sovereign State" as
a "breach of neutrality and friendship<a name=
"FNanchor817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817">[817]</a>."</p>
<p>Thus on receipt of the news of Napoleon's proposal the Cabinet
crisis was renewed and even more sharply than on October 23. The
French offer was not actually presented until November 10<a name=
"FNanchor818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818">[818]</a>. On the next
two days the answer to be made received long discussion in the
Cabinet. Lewis described this to Clarendon, prefacing his account
by stating that Russell had heard by telegram from Napier at St.
Petersburg to the effect that Russia would not join but would
support English-French proposals through her Minister at
Washington, "provided it would not cause irritation<a name=
"FNanchor819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819">[819]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_64"></a>[V2:pg 64]</span>
<blockquote>"Having made this statement, Lord John proceeded to
explain his views on the question. These were, briefly, that the
recent successes of the Democrats afforded a most favourable
opportunity of intervention, because we should strengthen their
hands, and that if we refused the invitation of France, Russia
would reconsider her decision, act directly with France, and thus
accomplish her favourite purpose of separating France and England.
He therefore advised that the proposal of France should be
accepted. Palmerston followed Lord John, and supported him, but did
not say a great deal. His principal argument was the necessity for
showing sympathy with Lancashire, and of not throwing away any
chance of mitigating it [<i>sic</i>].<br>
<br>
"The proposal was now thrown before the Cabinet, who proceeded to
pick it to pieces. Everybody present threw a stone at it of greater
or less size, except Gladstone, who supported it, and the
Chancellor [Westbury] and Cardwell, who expressed no opinion. The
principal objection was that the proposed armistice of six months
by sea and land, involving a suspension of the commercial blockade,
was so grossly unequal--so decidedly in favour of the South, that
there was no chance of the North agreeing to it. After a time,
Palmerston saw that the general feeling of the Cabinet was against
being a party to the representation, and he capitulated. I do not
think his support was very sincere: it certainly was not hearty ...
I ought to add that, after the Cabinet had come to a decision and
the outline of a draft had been discussed, the Chancellor uttered a
few oracular sentences on the danger of refusing the French
invitation, and gave a strong support to Lord John. His support
came rather late ... I proposed that we should <i>tater le
terrain</i> at Washington and ascertain whether there was any
chance of the proposal being accepted. Lord John refused this. He
admitted there was no chance of an affirmative answer from
Washington. I think his principal motive was a fear of displeasing
France, and that Palmerston's principal motive was a wish to seem
to support him. There is a useful <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_65"></a>[V2:pg 65]</span> article in to-day's <i>Times</i>
throwing cold water on the invitation. I take for granted that
Delane was informed of the result of the Cabinet<a name=
"FNanchor820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820">[820]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Gladstone, writing to his wife, gave a similar though more brief
account:</p>
<blockquote>"Nov. 11. We have had our Cabinet to-day and meet again
to-morrow. I am afraid we shall do little or nothing in the
business of America. But I will send you definite intelligence.
Both Lords Palmerston and Russell are <i>right.</i> Nov. 12. The
United States affair has ended and not well. Lord Russell rather
turned tail. He gave way without resolutely fighting out his
battle. However, though we decline for the moment, the answer is
put upon grounds and in terms which leave the matter very open for
the future. Nov. 13. I think the French will make our answer about
America public; at least it is very possible. But I hope they may
not take it as a positive refusal, or at any rate that they may
themselves act in the matter. It will be clear that we concur with
them, that the war should cease. Palmerston gave to Russell's
proposal a feeble and half-hearted support<a name=
"FNanchor821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821">[821]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The reply to France was in fact immediately made public both in
France and in England. It was complimentary to the Emperor's
"benevolent views and humane intentions," agreed that "if the steps
proposed were to be taken, the concurrence of Russia would be
extremely desirable" but remarked that as yet Great Britain had not
been informed that Russia wished to co-operate, and concluded that
since there was no ground to hope the North was ready for the
proposal it seemed best to postpone any overture until there was a
"greater prospect than now exists of its being accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_66"></a>[V2:pg 66]</span> by
the two contending parties<a name="FNanchor822"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_822">[822]</a>." The argument of Russell in the Cabinet
had been for acceptance without Russia though earlier he had
stipulated her assistance as essential. This was due to the
knowledge already at hand through a telegram from Napier at St.
Petersburg, November 8, that Russia would refuse<a name=
"FNanchor823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823">[823]</a>. But in the
answer to France it is the attitude of Russia that becomes an
important reason for British refusal as, indeed, it was the basis
for harmonious decision within the British Cabinet. This is not to
say that had Russia acceded England also would have done so, for
the weight of Cabinet opinion, adroitly encouraged by Palmerston,
was against Russell and the result reached was that which the
Premier wished. More important in his view than any other matter
was the preservation of a united Ministry and at the conclusion of
the American debate even Gladstone could write: "As to the state of
matters generally in the Cabinet, I have never seen it
smoother<a name="FNanchor824"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_824">[824]</a>."</p>
<p>Public opinion in England in the main heartily supported the
Cabinet decision. Hammond described it as "almost universal in this
country against interference<a name="FNanchor825"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_825">[825]</a>," an estimate justified if the more
important journals are taken into <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_67"></a>[V2:pg 67]</span> account but not true of all. The
<i>Times</i> of November 13 declared:</p>
<blockquote>"We are convinced that the present is not the moment
for these strong measures. There is now great reason to hope that
by means of their own internal action the Americans may themselves
settle their own affairs even sooner than Europe could settle them
for them. We have waited so long that it would be unpardonable in
us to lose the merit of our self-denial at such a moment as
this.... We quite agree with Mr. Cobden that it would be cheaper to
keep all Lancashire on turtle and venison than to plunge into a
desperate war with the Northern States of America, even with all
Europe at our back. In a good cause, and as a necessity forced upon
us in defence of our honour, or of our rightful interests, we are
as ready to fight as we ever were; but we do not see our duty or
our interest in going blindfold into an adventure such as this. We
very much doubt, more over, whether, if Virginia belonged to France
as Canada belongs to England, the Emperor of the French would be so
active in beating up for recruits in this American mediation
league."</blockquote>
<p>This was followed up two days later by an assertion that no
English statesman had at any time contemplated an offer of
mediation made in such a way as to lead to actual conflict with the
United States<a name="FNanchor826"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_826">[826]</a>. On the other hand the <i>Herald</i>,
always intense in its pro-Southern utterances, and strongly
anti-Palmerston in politics, professed itself unable to credit the
rumoured Cabinet decision. "Until we are positively informed that
our Ministers are guilty of the great crime attributed to them,"
the <i>Herald</i> declared, "we must hope against hope that they
are innocent." If guilty they were responsible for the misery of
Lancashire (depicted in lurid colours):</p>
<blockquote>"A clear, a sacred, an all-important duty was imposed
upon them; to perform that duty would have been the pride and
delight of almost any other Englishmen; and they, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_68"></a>[V2:pg 68]</span> with the task
before them and the power to perform it in their hands--can it be
that they have shrunk back in craven cowardice, deserted their
ally, betrayed their country, dishonoured their own names to all
eternity, that they might do the bidding of John Bright, and
sustain for a while the infamous tyranny of a Butler, a Seward, and
a Lincoln<a name="FNanchor827"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_827">[827]</a>?"</blockquote>
<p>In the non-political <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i> the returned
editor, W.H. Russell, but lately the <i>Times</i> correspondent in
America, jeered at the American uproar that might now be expected
against France instead of England: "Let the Emperor beware. The
scarred veteran of the New York Scarrons of Plum Gut has set his
sinister or dexter eye upon him, and threatens him with the loss of
his throne," but the British public must expect no lasting change
of Northern attitude toward England and must be ready for a war if
the North were victorious<a name="FNanchor828"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_828">[828]</a>. <i>Blackwood's</i> for November, 1862,
strongly censured the Government for its failure to act. The
<i>Edinburgh</i> for January, 1863, as strongly supported the
Ministry and expanded on the fixed determination of Great Britain
to keep out of the war. <i>The Index</i> naturally frothed in angry
disappointment, continuing its attacks, as if in hopes of a
reversal of Ministerial decision, even into the next year. "Has it
come to this? Is England, or the English Cabinet, afraid of the
Northern States? Lord Russell might contrive so to choose his
excuses as not to insult at once both his country and her
ally<a name="FNanchor829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829">[829]</a>."
An editorial from the <i>Richmond</i> (Virginia) <i>Whig</i> was
quoted with approval characterizing Russell and Palmerston as "two
old painted mummies," who secretly were rejoiced at the war in
America as "threatening the complete annihilation" of both sides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_69"></a>[V2:pg 69]</span> and
expressing the conviction that if the old Union were restored both
North and South would eagerly turn on Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830">[830]</a>. The
explanation, said <i>The Index</i>, of British supineness was
simply the pusillanimous fear of war--and of a war that would not
take place in spite of the bluster of Lincoln's "hangers-on<a name=
"FNanchor831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831">[831]</a>." Even as late
as May of the year following, this explanation was still harped
upon and Russell "a statesman" who belonged "rather to the past
than to the present" was primarily responsible for British
inaction. "The nominal conduct of Foreign Affairs is in the hands
of a diplomatic Malaprop, who has never shown vigour, activity, or
determination, except where the display of these qualities was
singularly unneeded, or even worse than useless<a name=
"FNanchor832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832">[832]</a>."</p>
<p><i>The Index</i> never wavered from its assumption that in the
Cabinet Russell was the chief enemy of the South. Slidell, better
informed, wrote: "Who would have believed that Earl Russell would
have been the only member of the Cabinet besides Gladstone in
favour of accepting the Emperor's proposition<a name=
"FNanchor833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833">[833]</a>?" He had
information that Napoleon had been led to expect his proposal would
be accepted and was much irritated--so much so that France would
now probably act alone<a name="FNanchor834"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_834">[834]</a>. Gladstone's attitude was a sorrow to
many of his friends. Bright believed he was at last weaned from
desires for mediation and sympathetic with the answer to
France<a name="FNanchor835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835">[835]</a>,
but Goldwin Smith in correspondence with Gladstone on American
affairs knew that the wild idea now in the statesman's mind was of
offering <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_70"></a>[V2:pg
70]</span> Canada to the North if she would let the South
go<a name="FNanchor836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836">[836]</a>--a
plan unknown, fortunately for Gladstone's reputation for good
judgment, save to his correspondent.</p>
<p>In general, as the weeks passed, the satisfaction grew both with
the public and in the Government that England had made no adventure
of new policy towards America. This satisfaction was strongly
reinforced when the first reports were received from Lyons on his
arrival in America. Reaching New York on November 8 he found that
even the "Conservatives" were much opposed to an offer of mediation
at present and thought it would only do harm until there was a
change of Government in Washington--an event still remote. Lyons
himself believed mediation useless unless intended to be followed
by recognition of the South and that such recognition was likewise
of no value without a raising of the blockade for which he thought
the British Cabinet not prepared<a name="FNanchor837"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_837">[837]</a>. Lyons flatly contradicted Stuart's
reports, his cool judgment of conditions nowhere more clearly
manifested than at this juncture in comparison with his
subordinate's excited and eager pro-Southern arguments. Again on
November 28 Lyons wrote that he could not find a single Northern
paper that did not repudiate <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_71"></a>[V2:pg 71]</span> foreign intervention<a name=
"FNanchor838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838">[838]</a>. In the South,
when it was learned that France had offered to act and England had
refused, there was an outburst of bitter anti-British
feeling<a name="FNanchor839"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_839">[839]</a>.</p>
<p>The Northern press, as Lyons had reported, was unanimous in
rejection of European offers of aid, however friendly, in settling
the war. It expressed no gratitude to England, devoting its energy
rather to animadversions on Napoleon III who was held to be
personally responsible. Since there had been no European offer made
there was no cause for governmental action. Seward had given Adams
specific instructions in case the emergency arose but there had
been no reason to present these or to act upon them and the crisis
once past Seward believed all danger of European meddling was over
and permanently. He wrote to Bigelow: "We are no longer to be
disturbed by Secession intrigues in Europe. They have had their
day. We propose to forget them<a name="FNanchor840"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_840">[840]</a>." This was a wise and statesmanlike
attitude and was shared by Adams in London. Whatever either man
knew or guessed of the prelude to the answer to France, November
13, they were careful to accept that answer as fulfilment of
Russell's declaration to Adams, October 23, that Great Britain
intended no change of policy<a name="FNanchor841"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_841">[841]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_72"></a>[V2:pg 72]</span>
<p>So far removed was Seward's attitude toward England from that
ascribed to him in 1861, so calm was his treatment of questions now
up for immediate consideration, so friendly was he personally
toward Lyons, that the British Minister became greatly alarmed
when, shortly after his return to Washington, there developed a
Cabinet controversy threatening the retirement of the Secretary of
State. This was a quarrel brought on by the personal sensibilities
of Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, and directed at Seward's
conduct of foreign affairs. It was quieted by the tact and
authority of Lincoln, who, when Seward handed in his resignation,
secured from Chase a similar offer of resignation, refused both and
in the result read to Chase that lesson of Presidential control
which Seward had learned in May, 1861. Lyons wrote of this
controversy "I shall be sorry if it ends in the removal of Mr.
Seward. We are much more likely to have a man less disposed to keep
the peace than a man more disposed to do so. I should hardly have
said this two years ago<a name="FNanchor842"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_842">[842]</a>." After the event of Seward's retention
of office Russell wrote: "I see Seward stays in. I am very glad of
it<a name="FNanchor843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843">[843]</a>."
This is a remarkable reversal of former opinion. A better
understanding of Seward had come, somewhat slowly, to British
diplomats, but since his action in the <i>Trent</i> affair former
suspicion had steadily waned; his "high tone" being regarded as for
home consumption, until now there was both belief in Seward's basic
friendliness and respect for his abilities.</p>
<p>Thus Russell's ambitious mediation projects having finally
dwindled to a polite refusal of the French offer to join in a mere
suggestion of armistice left no open sores in the British relations
with America. The projects were unknown; the refusal seemed final
to Seward and was indeed destined to prove so. But of this there
was no clear <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_73"></a>[V2:pg
73]</span> conception in the British Cabinet. Hardly anyone yet
believed that reconquest of the South was even a remote possibility
and this foretold that the day must some time come when European
recognition would have to be given the Confederacy. It is this
unanimity of opinion on the ultimate result of the war in America
that should always be kept in mind in judging the attitude of
British Government and people in the fall of 1862. Their sympathies
were of minor concern at the moment, nor were they much in evidence
during the Cabinet crisis. All argument was based upon the
expediency and wisdom of the present proposal. Could European
nations <i>now</i> act in such a way as to bring to an early end a
war whose result in separation was inevitable? It was the hope that
such action promised good results which led Russell to enter upon
his policy even though personally his sympathies were
unquestionably with the North. It was, in the end, the conviction
that <i>now</i> was not a favourable time which determined
Palmerston, though sympathetic with the South, to withdraw his
support when Russell, through pique, insisted on going on. Moreover
both statesmen were determined not to become involved in the war
and as the possible consequences of even the "most friendly" offers
were brought out in discussion it became clear that Great Britain's
true policy was to await a return of sanity in the
contestants<a name="FNanchor844"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_844">[844]</a>.</p>
<p>For America Russell's mediation plan constitutes the most
dangerous crisis in the war for the restoration of the Union. Had
that plan been adopted, no matter how friendly in intent, there is
little question that Lewis' forebodings <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_74"></a>[V2:pg 74]</span> would have been
realized and war would have ensued between England and the North.
But also whatever its results in other respects the independence of
the South would have been established. Slavery, hated of Great
Britain, would have received a new lease of life--and by British
action. In the Cabinet argument all parties agreed that Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation was but an incitement to servile war and
it played no part in the final decision. Soon that proclamation was
to erect a positive barrier of public opinion against any future
efforts to secure British intervention. Never again was there
serious governmental consideration of meddling in the American
Civil War<a name="FNanchor845"></a><a href=

consultation with Seward, advised that any offer at present would
only make matters worse. It would be best to wait and see what the
next spring would bring forth (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to F.O.,

emphatic; an offer of mediation would accomplish nothing unless
backed up by force to open the Southern ports; this had always been
Lyons' opinion also; before leaving for England, Lyons had told him
"we ought not to venture on mediation unless we are ready to go to
war." Mercier, however, was eager for action and believed that if
France came forward, supported by the other Powers, especially
Russia, the United States would be compelled to yield. To this

as, summarized, (1) an invitation to France and Russia to join with
England in offering good services to the United States looking
towards peace. (2) Much importance attached to the adhesion of
Russia. (3) Excellent chance of success. (4) Nevertheless a
possible refusal by the United States, in which case, (5)
recognition by Great Britain of the South if it seemed likely that
this could be done without giving the United States a just ground
of quarrel. Brunow commented that this would be "eventually" the
action of Great Britain, but that meanwhile circumstances might
delay it. Especially he was impressed that the Cabinet felt the
political necessity of "doing something" before Parliament
reassembled (Russian Archives, Brunow to F.O., London, Oct. 1, 1862
(N.S.). No. 1698.) Gortchakoff promptly transmitted this to
Stoeckl, together with a letter from Brunow, dated Bristol, Oct. 1,
1862 (N.S.), in which Brunow expressed the opinion that one object
of the British Government was to introduce at Washington a topic
which would serve to accentuate the differences that were
understood to exist in Lincoln's Cabinet. (This seems very
far-fetched.) Gortchakoff's comment in sending all this to Stoeckl
was that Russia had no intention of changing her policy of extreme
friendship to the United States (<i>Ibid.</i>, F.O. to Stoeckl,

interview with Napoleon on October 28 bearing on an armistice, but
this was copied as October 22 in Bigelow's <i>France and the

Paris, was instructed that while Russia had always been anxious to
forward peace in America, she stood in peculiarly friendly
relations with the United States, and was against any appearance of
pressure. It would have the contrary effect from that hoped for. If
England and France should offer mediation Russia, "being too far
away," would not join, but might give her moral support. (Russian
Archives, F.O. to D'Oubril, Oct. 27, 1862 (O.S.). No. 320.) On the
same date Stoeckl was informed of the French overtures, and was
instructed not to take a stand with France and Great Britain, but
to limit his efforts to approval of any <i>agreement</i> by the
North and South to end the war. Yet Stoeckl was given liberty of
action if (as Gortchakoff did not believe) the time had assuredly
come when both North and South were ready for peace, and it needed
but the influence of some friendly hand to soothe raging passions
and to lead the contending parties themselves to begin direct
negotiations (<i>Ibid.</i>, F.O. to Stoeckl, Oct. 27, 1862

refused the South would be recognized. Stoeckl commented to the
Foreign Office: "What good will this do?" It would not procure
cotton unless the ports were forced open and a clear rupture made
with the North. He thought England understood this, and still
hesitated. Stoeckl went on to urge that if all European Powers
joined England and France they would be merely tails to the kite
and that Russia would be one of the tails. This would weaken the
Russian position in Europe as well as forfeit her special
relationship with the United States. He was against any
<i>joint</i> European action. (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to F.O.,
Nov. 5-17, 1862, No. 2002.) Gortchakoff wrote on the margin of this
despatch: "Je trouve son opinion tr&egrave;s sage." If Stoeckl
understood Lyons correctly then the latter had left England still
believing that his arguments with Russell had been of no effect.
When the news reached Washington of England's refusal of the French
offer, Stoeckl reported Lyons as much surprised (<i>Ibid.</i>, to

<h3>THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION</h3>
<br>
<p>The finality of the British Cabinet decision in November, 1862,
relative to proposals of mediation or intervention was not accepted
at the moment though time was to prove its permanence. The British
press was full of suggestions that the first trial might more
gracefully come from France since that country was presumed to be
on more friendly terms with the United States<a name=
"FNanchor846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846">[846]</a>. Others,
notably Slidell at Paris, held the same view, and on January 8,
1863, Slidell addressed a memorandum to Napoleon III, asking
separate recognition of the South. The next day, Napoleon dictated
an instruction to Mercier offering friendly mediation in courteous
terms but with no hint of an armistice or of an intended
recognition of the South<a name="FNanchor847"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_847">[847]</a>. Meanwhile, Mercier had again approached
Lyons alleging that he had been urged by Greeley, editor of the
<i>New York Tribune</i>, to make an isolated French offer, but that
he felt this would be contrary to the close harmony hitherto
maintained in French-British relations. But Mercier added that if
Lyons was disinclined to a proposal of mediation, he intended to
advise his Government to give him authority to act alone<a name=
"FNanchor848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848">[848]</a>. Lyons made no
comment to Mercier but wrote to Russell, "I certainly desire that
the Settlement of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_76"></a>[V2:pg 76]</span> Contest should be made without the
intervention of England."</p>
<p>A week later the Russian Minister, Stoeckl, also came to Lyons
desiring to discover what would be England's attitude if Russia
should act alone, or perhaps with France, leaving England out of a
proposal to the North<a name="FNanchor849"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_849">[849]</a>. This was based on the supposition that
the North, weary of war, might ask the good offices of Russia.
Lyons replied that he did not think that contingency near and
otherwise evaded Stoeckl's questions; but he was somewhat
suspicious, concluding his report, "I cannot quite forget that
Monsieur Mercier and Monsieur de Stoeckl had agreed to go to
Richmond together last Spring<a name="FNanchor850"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_850">[850]</a>." The day after this despatch was written
Mercier presented, February 3, the isolated French offer and on
February 6 received Seward's reply couched in argumentative, yet
polite language, but positively declining the proposal<a name=
"FNanchor851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851">[851]</a>. Evidently
Lyons was a bit disquieted by the incident; but in London,
Napoleon's overture to America was officially stated to be
unobjectionable, as indeed was required by the implications of the
reply of November 13, to France. Russell, on February 14, answered
Lyons' communications in a letter marked "Seen by Lord Palmerston
and the Queen":</p>
<blockquote>"Her Majesty's Government have no wish to interfere at
present in any way in the Civil War. If France were to offer good
offices or mediation, Her Majesty's Government would feel no
jealousy or repugnance to such a course on the part of France
alone<a name="FNanchor852"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_852">[852]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_77"></a>[V2:pg 77]</span>
<p>The writing of this despatch antedated the knowledge that France
had already acted at Washington, and does not necessarily indicate
any governmental feeling of a break in previous close relations
with France on the American question. Yet this was indubitably the
case and became increasingly evident as time passed. Russell's
despatch to Lyons of February 14 appears rather to be evidence of
the effect of the debates in Parliament when its sessions were
resumed on February 5, for in both Lords and Commons there was
given a hearty and nearly unanimous support of the Government's
decision to make no overture for a cessation of the conflict in
America. Derby clearly outlined the two possible conditions of
mediation; first, when efforts by the North to subdue the South had
practically ceased; and second, if humane interests required action
by neutral states, in which case the intervening parties must be
fully prepared to use force. Neither condition had arrived and
strict neutrality was the wise course. Disraeli also approved
strict neutrality but caustically referred to Gladstone's Newcastle
speech and sharply attacked the Cabinet's uncertain and changeable
policy--merely a party speech. Russell upheld the Government's
decision but went out of his way to assert that the entire
subjugation of the South would be a calamity to the United States
itself, since it would require an unending use of force to hold the
South in submission<a name="FNanchor853"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_853">[853]</a>. Later, when news of the French offer at
Washington had been received, the Government was attacked in the
Lords by an undaunted friend of the South, Lord Campbell, on the
ground of a British divergence from close relations with France.
Russell, in a brief reply, reasserted old arguments that the time
had "not yet" come, but now declared that events seemed to show the
possibility of a complete Northern victory and added with emphasis
that recognition of the South <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_78"></a>[V2:pg 78]</span> could justly be regarded by the
North as an "unfriendly act<a name="FNanchor854"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_854">[854]</a>."</p>
<p>Thus Parliament and Cabinet were united against meddling in
America, basing this attitude on neutral duty and national
interests, and with barely a reference to the new policy of the
North toward slavery, declared in the emancipation proclamations of
September 22, 1862, and January 1, 1863, Had these great documents
then no favourable influence on British opinion and action? Was the
Northern determination to root out the institution of slavery, now
clearly announced, of no effect in winning the favour of a people
and Government long committed to a world policy against that
institution? It is here necessary to review early British opinion,
the facts preceding the first emancipation proclamation, and to
examine its purpose in the mind of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Before the opening of actual military operations, while there
was still hope of some peaceful solution, British opinion had been
with the North on the alleged ground of sympathy with a free as
against a slave-owning society. But war once begun the disturbance
to British trade interests and Lincoln's repeated declarations that
the North had no intention of destroying slavery combined to offer
an excuse and a reason for an almost complete shift of British
opinion. The abolitionists of the North and the extreme
anti-slavery friends in England, relatively few in number in both
countries, still sounded the note of "slavery the cause of the
war," but got little hearing. Nevertheless it was seen by
thoughtful minds that slavery was certain to have a distinct
bearing on the position of Great Britain when the war was
concluded. In May, 1861, Palmerston declared that it would be a
happy day when "we could succeed in putting an end to this
unnatural war between the two sections of our North American
cousins," but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_79"></a>[V2:pg
79]</span> added that the difficulty for England was that
"<i>We</i> could not well mix ourselves up with the acknowledgment
of slavery<a name="FNanchor855"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_855">[855]</a>...."</p>
<p>Great Britain's long-asserted abhorrence of slavery caused,
indeed, a perplexity in governmental attitude. But this looked to
the final outcome of an independent South--an outcome long taken
for granted. Debate on the existing moralities of the war very soon
largely disappeared from British discussion and in its place there
cropped out, here and there, expressions indicative of anxiety as
to whether the war could long continue without a "servile
insurrection," with all its attendant horrors.</p>
<p>On July 6, 1861, the <i>Economist</i>, reviewing the progress of
the war preparations to date, asserted that it was universally
agreed no restoration of the Union was possible and answered
British fears by declaring it was impossible to believe that even
the American madness could contemplate a servile insurrection. The
friendly <i>Spectator</i> also discussed the matter and repeatedly.
It was a mistaken idea, said this journal, that there could be no
enfranchisement without a slave rising, but should this occur, "the
right of the slave to regain his freedom, even if the effort
involve slaughter, is as clear as any other application of the
right of self-defence<a name="FNanchor856"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_856">[856]</a>." Yet English abolitionists should not
urge the slave to act for himself, since "as war goes on and all
compromise fails the American mind will harden under the white heat
and determine that the <i>cause</i> of all conflict must cease."
That slavery, in spite of any declaration by Lincoln or Northern
denial of a purpose to attack it--denials which disgusted Harriet
Martineau--was in real fact the basic cause of the war, seemed to
her as clear as anything in reason<a name=
"FNanchor857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857">[857]</a>. She had no
patience with English <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_80"></a>[V2:pg 80]</span> anti-slavery people who believed
Northern protestations, and she did not express concern over the
horrors of a possible servile insurrection. Nevertheless this
spectre was constantly appearing. Again the <i>Spectator</i> sought
to allay such fears; but yet again also proclaimed that even such a
contingency was less fearful than the consolidation of the
slave-power in the South<a name="FNanchor858"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_858">[858]</a>.</p>
<p>Thus a servile insurrection was early and frequently an argument
which pro-Northern friends were compelled to meet. In truth the
bulk of the British press was constant in holding up this bogie to
its readers, even going to the point of weakening its argument of
the impossibility of a Northern conquest of the South by appealing
to history to show that England in her two wars with America had
had a comparatively easy time in the South, thus postulating the
real danger of some "negro Garibaldi calling his countrymen to
arms<a name="FNanchor859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859">[859]</a>."
Nor was this fear merely a pretended one. It affected all classes
and partisans of both sides. Even official England shared in it;
January 20, 1862, Lyons wrote, "The question is rapidly tending
towards the issue either of peace and a recognition of the
separation, or a Proclamation of Emancipation and the raising of a
servile insurrection<a name="FNanchor860"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_860">[860]</a>." At nearly the same time Russell,
returning to Gladstone a letter from Sumner to Cobden, expressed
his sorrow "that the President intends a war of emancipation,
meaning thereby, I fear, a war of greater desolation than has been
since the revival of letters<a name="FNanchor861"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_861">[861]</a>." John Stuart Mill, with that clear logic
which appealed to the more intelligent reader, in an able
examination of the underlying causes and probable results of the
American conflict, excused the Northern leaders for early denial of
a purpose to attack slavery, but expressed complete confidence that
even these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_81"></a>[V2:pg
81]</span> leaders by now understood the "almost certain results of
success in the present conflict" (the extinction of slavery) and
prophesied that "if the writers who so severely criticize the
present moderation of the Free-soilers are desirous to see the war
become an abolition war, it is probable that if the war lasts long
enough they will be gratified<a name="FNanchor862"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_862">[862]</a>." John Bright, reaching a wider public,
in speech after speech, expressed faith that the people of the
North were "marching on, as I believe, to its [slavery's] entire
abolition<a name="FNanchor863"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_863">[863]</a>."</p>
<p>Pro-Southern Englishmen pictured the horrors of an "abolition
war," and believed the picture true; strict neutrals, like Lyons,
feared the same development; friends of the North pushed aside the
thought of a "negro terror," yet even while hoping and declaring
that the war would destroy slavery, could not escape from
apprehensions of an event that appeared inevitable. Everywhere, to
the British mind, it seemed that emancipation was necessarily a
provocative to servile insurrection, and this belief largely
affected the reception of the emancipation proclamation--a fact
almost wholly lost sight of in historical writing.</p>
<p>Nor did the steps taken in America leading up to emancipation
weaken this belief--rather they appeared to justify it. The great
advocate of abolition as a weapon in the war and for its own sake
was Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations. He early took the ground that a proclamation everywhere
emancipating the slaves would give to the Northern cause a moral
support hitherto denied it in Europe and would at the same time
strike a blow at Southern resistance. This idea was presented in a
public speech at Worcester, Massachusetts, in October, 1861, but
even Sumner's free-soil friends thought him mistaken and his
expressions "unfortunate." By December, however, he found at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_82"></a>[V2:pg 82]</span>
Washington a change in governmental temper and from that date
Sumner was constant, through frequent private conversations with
Lincoln, in pressing for action. These ideas and his personal
activities for their realization were well known to English
friends, as in his letters to Cobden and Bright, and to the English
public in general through Sumner's speeches, for Sumner had long
been a well-known figure in the British press<a name=
"FNanchor864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864">[864]</a>.</p>
<p>Lincoln, never an "Abolitionist," in spite of his famous
utterance in the 'fifties that the United States could not
indefinitely continue to exist "half-slave and half-free," had, in
1861, disapproved and recalled the orders of some of the military
leaders, like Fremont, who without authority had sought to extend
emancipation to slaves within the lines of their command. But as
early as anyone he had foreseen the gradual emergence of
emancipation as a war problem, at first dangerous to that wise
"border state policy" which had prevented the more northern of the
slave states from seceding. His first duty was to restore the Union
and to that he gave all his energy, yet that emancipation, when the
time was ripe, was also in Lincoln's mind is evident from the
gradual approach through legislation and administrative act. In
February, 1862, a Bill was under discussion in Congress, called the
"Confiscation Bill," which, among other clauses, provided that all
slaves of persons engaged in rebellion against the United States,
who should by escape, or capture, come into the possession of the
military forces of the United States, should be for ever free; but
that this provision should not be operative until the expiration of
sixty days, thus giving slave-owners opportunity to cease their
rebellion and retain their slaves<a name="FNanchor865"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_865">[865]</a>. This measure did not at first have
Lincoln's approval for he feared its effect on the loyalists of the
border states. Nevertheless he <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_83"></a>[V2:pg 83]</span> realized the growing strength of
anti-slavery sentiment in the war and fully sympathized with it
where actual realization did not conflict with the one great object
of his administration. Hence in March, 1862, he heartily concurred
in a measure passed rapidly to Presidential approval, April 16,
freeing the slaves in the District of Columbia, a territory where
there was no question of the constitutional power of the national
Government.</p>
<p>From February, 1862, until the issue of the first emancipation
proclamation in September, there was, in truth, a genuine conflict
between Congress and President as to methods and extent of
emancipation. Congress was in a mood to punish the South; Lincoln,
looking steadily toward re-union, yet realizing the rising strength
of anti-slavery in the North, advocated a gradual, voluntary, and
compensated emancipation. Neither party spoke the word "servile
insurrection," yet both realized its possibility, and Seward, in
foreign affairs, was quick to see and use it as a threat. A brief
summary of measures will indicate the contest. March 6, Lincoln
sent a message to Congress recommending that a joint resolution be
passed pledging the pecuniary aid of the national Government to any
state voluntarily emancipating its slaves, his avowed purpose being
to secure early action by the loyal border states in the hope that
this might influence the Southern states<a name=
"FNanchor866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866">[866]</a>. Neither the
House of Representatives nor the Senate were really favourable to
this resolution and the border states bitterly opposed it in
debate, but it passed by substantial majorities in both branches
and was approved by Lincoln on April 10. In effect the extreme
radical element in Congress had yielded, momentarily, to the
President's insistence on an olive-branch offering of compensated
emancipation. Both as regards the border states and looking to the
restoration of the Union, Lincoln was determined to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_84"></a>[V2:pg 84]</span> give this line
of policy a trial. The prevailing sentiment of Congress, however,
preferred the punitive Confiscation Bill.</p>
<p>At this juncture General Hunter, in command of the "Department
of the South," which theoretically included also the States of
South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, issued an order declaring the
slaves in these states free. This was May 9, 1862. Lincoln
immediately countermanded Hunter's order, stating that such action
"under my responsibility, I reserve to myself<a name=
"FNanchor867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867">[867]</a>." He renewed,
in this same proclamation, earnest appeals to the border states, to
embrace the opportunity offered by the Congressional resolution of
April 10. In truth, border state attitude was the test of the
feasibility of Lincoln's hoped-for voluntary emancipation, but
these states were unwilling to accept the plan. Meanwhile pressure
was being exerted for action on the Confiscation Bill; it was
pushed through Congress and presented to Lincoln for his signature
or veto. He signed it on July 12, <i>but did not notify that fact
to Congress until July 17.</i> On this same day of signature, July
12, Lincoln sent to Congress a proposal of an Act to give pecuniary
aid in voluntary state emancipation and held a conference with the
congressional representatives of the border states seeking their
definite approval of his policy. A minority agreed but the majority
were emphatically against him. The Confiscation Bill would not
affect the border states; they were not in rebellion. And they did
not desire to free the slaves even if compensated<a name=
"FNanchor868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868">[868]</a>.</p>
<p>Thus Lincoln, by the stubbornness of the border states, was
forced toward the Congressional point of view as expressed in the
Confiscation Bill. On the day following his failure to win the
border state representatives he told Seward and Welles who were
driving with him, that he had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_85"></a>[V2:pg 85]</span> come to the conclusion that the
time was near for the issue of a proclamation of emancipation as a
military measure fully within the competence of the President. This
was on July 13<a name="FNanchor869"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_869">[869]</a>. Seward offered a few objections but
apparently neither Cabinet official did more than listen to
Lincoln's argument of military necessity. Congress adjourned on
July 17. On July 22, the President read to the Cabinet a draft of
an emancipation proclamation the text of the first paragraph of
which referred to the Confiscation Act and declared that this would
be rigorously executed unless rebellious subjects returned to their
allegiance. But the remainder of the draft reasserted the ideal of
a gradual and compensated emancipation and concluded with the
warning that for states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, a
general emancipation of slaves would be proclaimed<a name=
"FNanchor870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870">[870]</a>. All of the
Cabinet approved except Blair who expressed fears of the effect on
the approaching November elections, and Seward who, while
professing sympathy with the indicated purpose, argued that the
time was badly chosen in view of recent military disasters and the
approach of Lee's army toward Washington. The measure, Seward said,
might "be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government, a
cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to
Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the
government. It will be considered our last <i>shriek</i> on the
retreat." He therefore urged postponement until after a Northern
victory. This appealed to Lincoln and he "put the draft of the
proclamation aside, waiting for victory<a name=
"FNanchor871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871">[871]</a>."</p>
<p>Victory came in September, with McClellan's defeat of Lee at
Antietam, and the retreat of the Southern army toward Richmond.
Five days later, September 22, Lincoln <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_86"></a>[V2:pg 86]</span> issued the
proclamation, expanded and altered in text from the draft of July
22, but in substance the same<a name="FNanchor872"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_872">[872]</a>. The loyal border states were not to be
affected, but the proclamation renewed the promise of steps to be
taken to persuade them to voluntary action. On January 1, 1863, a
second proclamation, referring to that of September 22, was issued
by Lincoln "by virtue of the power in me vested as
commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States in
time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and Government
of the United States...." The states affected were designated by
name and all persons held as slaves within them "are, and
henceforward shall be, free...." "I hereby enjoin upon the people
so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in
necessary self-defence...." "And upon this act, sincerely believed
to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon
military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind,
and the gracious favour of Almighty God<a name=
"FNanchor873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873">[873]</a>."</p>
<p>Such were the steps, from December, 1861, when the radical
Sumner began his pressure for action, to September, 1862, when
Lincoln's pledge of emancipation was made. Did these steps
indicate, as British opinion unquestionably held, an intention to
rouse a servile insurrection? Was the Confiscation Bill passed with
that purpose in view and had Lincoln decided to carry it into
effect? The failure of the slaves to rise is, indeed, the great
marvel of the Civil War and was so regarded not in England only,
but in America also. It was the expectation of the North and the
constant fear of the South. But was this, in truth, the
<i>purpose</i> of the emancipation proclamation?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_87"></a>[V2:pg 87]</span>
<p>This purpose has been somewhat summarily treated by American
historians, largely because of lack of specific evidence as to
motives at the time of issue. Two words "military necessity" are
made to cover nearly the entire argument for emancipation in
September, 1862, but in just what manner the military prowess of
the North was to be increased was not at first indicated. In 1864,
Lincoln declared that after the failure of successive efforts to
persuade the border states to accept compensated emancipation he
had believed there had arrived the "indispensable necessity for
military emancipation and arming the blacks<a name=
"FNanchor874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874">[874]</a>." Repeatedly in
later defence of the proclamation he urged the benefits that had
come from his act and asserted that commanders in the field
"believe the emancipation policy and the use of coloured troops
constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion<a name=
"FNanchor875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875">[875]</a>." He added:
"negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do
anything for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake
their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive,
even the promise of freedom."</p>
<p>There is no note here of stirring a servile insurrection; nor
did Lincoln ever acknowledge that such a purpose had been in his
mind, though the thought of such possible result must have been
present--was, indeed, present to most minds even without a
proclamation of emancipation. Lincoln's alleged purpose was simply
to draw away slaves, wherever possible, from their rebellious
masters, thus reducing the economic powers of resistance of the
South, and then to make these ex-slaves directly useful in winning
the war. But after the war, even here and there during it, a theory
was advanced that an impelling motive with the President had been
the hope of influencing favourably <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_88"></a>[V2:pg 88]</span> foreign governments and peoples by
stamping the Northern cause with a high moral purpose. In popular
opinion, Lincoln came to be regarded as a far-visioned statesman in
anticipating that which ultimately came to pass. This has important
bearing on the relations of the United States and Great
Britain.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that nearly every Northern American had
believed in 1860, that anti-slavery England would sympathize
strongly with the North. The event did not prove this to be the
case, nor could the North justly complain in the face of
administration denials of an anti-slavery purpose. The English
Government therefore was widely upheld by British opinion in
regarding the struggle from the point of view of British interests.
Yet any Northern step antagonistic to the institution of slavery
compelled British governmental consideration. As early as December,
1860, before the war began, Bunch, at Charleston, had reported a
conversation with Rhett, in which the latter frankly declared that
the South would expect to revive the African Slave Trade<a name=
"FNanchor876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876">[876]</a>. This was
limited in the constitution later adopted by the Confederacy which
in substance left the matter to the individual states--a condition
that Southern agents in England found it hard to explain<a name=
"FNanchor877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877">[877]</a>. As already
noted, the ardent friends of the North continued to insist, even
after Lincoln's denial, that slavery was the real cause of the
American rupture<a name="FNanchor878"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_878">[878]</a>. By September, 1861, John Bright was
writing to his friend Sumner that, all indications to the contrary,
England would warmly support the North <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_89"></a>[V2:pg 89]</span> if only it could
be shown that emancipation was an object<a name=
"FNanchor879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879">[879]</a>. Again and
again he urged, it is interesting to note, just those ideals of
gradual and compensated emancipation which were so strongly held by
Lincoln. In this same month the <i>Spectator</i> thought it was
"idle to strive to ignore the very centre and spring of all
disunion," and advised a "prudent audacity in striking at the cause
rather than at the effect<a name="FNanchor880"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_880">[880]</a>." Three weeks later the <i>Spectator</i>,
reviewing general British press comments, summed them up as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"If you make it a war of emancipation we shall think
you madmen, and tell you so, though the ignorant instincts of
Englishmen will support you. And if you follow our counsel in
holding a tight rein on the Abolitionists, we shall applaud your
worldly wisdom so far; but shall deem it our duty to set forth
continually that you have forfeited all claim to the <i>popular</i>
sympathy of England."</blockquote>
<p>This, said the <i>Spectator</i>, had been stated in the most
objectionable style by the <i>Times</i> in particular, which,
editorially, had alleged that "the North has now lost the chance of
establishing a high moral superiority by a declaration against
slavery." To all this the <i>Spectator</i> declared that the North
must adopt the bold course and make clear that restoration of the
Union was not intended with the old canker at its roots<a name=
"FNanchor881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881">[881]</a>.</p>
<p>Official England held a different view. Russell believed that
the separation of North and South would conduce to the extinction
of slavery since the South, left to itself and fronted by a great
and prosperous free North, with a population united in ideals,
would be forced, ultimately, to abandon its "special system." He
professed that he could not understand Mrs. Stowe's support of the
war <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_90"></a>[V2:pg 90]</span>
and thought she and Sumner "animated by a spirit of
vengeance<a name="FNanchor882"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_882">[882]</a>." If the South did yield and the Union
were restored <i>with</i> slavery, Russell thought that "Slavery
would prevail all over the New World. For that reason I wish for
separation<a name="FNanchor883"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_883">[883]</a>." These views were repeated frequently by
Russell. He long had a fixed idea on the moral value of separation,
but was careful to state, "I give you these views merely as
speculations," and it is worthy of note that after midsummer of
1862 he rarely indulged in them. Against such speculations, whether
by Russell or by others, Mill protested in his famous article in
<i>Fraser's</i>, February, 1862<a name="FNanchor884"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_884">[884]</a>.</p>
<p>On one aspect of slavery the North was free to act and early did
so. Seward proposed to Lyons a treaty giving mutual right of search
off the African Coast and on the coasts of Cuba for the suppression
of the African Slave Trade. Such a treaty had long been urged by
Great Britain but persistently refused by the United States. It
could not well be declined now by the British Government and was
signed by Seward, April 8, 1862<a name="FNanchor885"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_885">[885]</a>, but if he expected any change in British
attitude as a result he was disappointed. The renewal by the South
of that trade might be a barrier to British goodwill, but the
action of the North was viewed as but a weak attempt to secure
British sympathy, and to mark the limits of Northern anti-slavery
efforts. Indeed, the Government was not eager for the treaty on
other grounds, since the Admiralty had never "felt any interest in
the suppression of the slave trade ... whatever they have done ...
they have done grudgingly and imperfectly<a name=
"FNanchor886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886">[886]</a>."</p>
<p>This was written at the exact period when Palmerston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_91"></a>[V2:pg 91]</span> and
Russell were initiating those steps which were to result in the
Cabinet crisis on mediation in October-November, 1862. Certainly
the Slave Trade treaty with America had not influenced governmental
attitude. At this juncture there was founded, November, 1862, the
London Emancipation Society, with the avowed object of stirring
anti-slavery Englishmen in protest against "favouring the South."
But George Thompson, its organizer, had been engaged in the
preliminary work of organization for some months and the Society is
therefore to be regarded as an expression of that small group who
were persistent and determined in assertion of slavery as the cause
and object of the Civil War, before the issue of Lincoln's
proclamation<a name="FNanchor887"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_887">[887]</a>. Thus for England as a whole and for
official England the declarations of these few voices were regarded
as expressive of a wish rather than as consistent with the facts.
The moral uplift of an anti-slavery object was denied to the
North.</p>
<p>This being so did Lincoln seek to correct the foreign view by
the emancipation proclamation? There is some, but scant ground for
so believing. It is true that this aspect had at various times,
though rarely, been presented to the President. Carl Schurz,
American Minister at Madrid, wrote to Seward as early as September
14, 1861, strongly urging the declaration of an anti-slavery
purpose in the war and asserting that public opinion in Europe
would then be such in favour of the North that no government would
"dare to place itself, by declaration or act, upon the side of a
universally condemned institution<a name="FNanchor888"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_888">[888]</a>." There is no evidence that Seward showed
this despatch to Lincoln, but in January, 1862, Schurz returned to
America and in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_92"></a>[V2:pg
92]</span> conversation with the President urged the "moral issue"
to prevent foreign intervention. The President replied: "You may be
right. Probably you are. I have been thinking so myself. I cannot
imagine that any European power would dare to recognize and aid the
Southern Confederacy if it became clear that the Confederacy stands
for slavery and the Union for freedom<a name=
"FNanchor889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889">[889]</a>." No doubt
others urged upon him the same view. Indeed, one sincere foreign
friend, Count Gasparin, who had early written in favour of the
North<a name="FNanchor890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890">[890]</a>,
and whose opinions were widely read, produced a second work in the
spring of 1862, in which the main theme was "slavery the issue."
The author believed emancipation inevitable and urged an instant
proclamation of Northern <i>intention</i> to free the
slaves<a name="FNanchor891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891">[891]</a>.
Presumably, Lincoln was familiar with this work. Meanwhile Sumner
pressed the same idea though adding the prevalent abolition
arguments which did not, necessarily, involve thought of foreign
effect. On the general question of emancipation Lincoln listened,
even telling Sumner that he "was ahead of himself only a month or
six weeks<a name="FNanchor892"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_892">[892]</a>."</p>
<p>Yet after the enactment of the "confiscation bill" in July,
1862, when strong abolitionist pressure was brought on the
President to issue a general proclamation of emancipation, he
reasserted in the famous reply to Greeley, August 22, 1862, his one
single purpose to restore the Union "with or without slavery."</p>
<blockquote>"If there be those who would not save the Union unless
they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with
them.<br>
<br>
"If there be those who would not save the Union unless <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_93"></a>[V2:pg 93]</span> they could at
the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them.<br>
<br>
"<i>My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to
save or to destroy slavery</i><a name="FNanchor893"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_893">[893]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Here seemed to be specific denial of raising a moral issue; yet
unknown to the public at the moment there had already been drafted
and discussed in Cabinet the emancipation proclamation. Greeley had
presented abolitionist demands essential to cement the North. A
month later, September 13, a delegation of Chicago clergymen came
to Washington, had an audience with Lincoln, presented similar
arguments, but also laid stress on the necessity of securing the
sympathy of Europe. This was but nine days before the first
proclamation was issued, but Lincoln replied much as to Greeley,
though he stated, "I will also concede that Emancipation would help
us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something
more than ambition<a name="FNanchor894"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_894">[894]</a>." Immediately after the event, September
24, making a short speech to a serenading party, Lincoln said, "I
can only trust in God I have made no mistake.... It is now for the
country and the world to pass judgment and, maybe, take action upon
it<a name="FNanchor895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895">[895]</a>."
Over a year later, December 8, 1863, in his annual message to
Congress, he noted a "much improved" tone in foreign countries as
resulting from the emancipation proclamation, but dwelt mainly on
the beneficial effects at home<a name="FNanchor896"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_896">[896]</a>.</p>
<p>Evidently there is slight ground for believing Lincoln to have
been convinced that foreign relations would be improved by the
proclamation. On the contrary, if he <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_94"></a>[V2:pg 94]</span> trusted Seward's judgment he may
have <i>feared</i> the effect on Europe, for such was Seward's
prophecy. Here may have lain the true meaning of Lincoln's speech
of September 24--that it was now for "the world to pass judgment
and, maybe, take action upon it." After all foreign policy, though
its main lines were subject to the President's control, was in the
hands of Seward and throughout this entire period of six months
since the introduction of the Confiscation Bill up to Lincoln's
presentation of his draft proclamation to the Cabinet in July,
Seward had been using the threat of a servile insurrection as a
deterrent upon French-British talk of intervention. At times Seward
connected servile insurrection with emancipation--at times not.</p>
<p>Seward had begun his career as Secretary of State with an appeal
to Europe on lines of old friendship and had implied, though he
could not state explicitly, the "noble" cause of the North. He had
been met with what he considered a "cold" and premature as well as
unjustifiable declaration of neutrality. From the first day of the
conflict Lyons and Mercier had been constant in representing the
hardships inflicted by the American war upon the economic interests
of their respective countries. Both men bore down upon the
interruption of the cotton trade and Seward kept repeating that
Northern victories would soon release the raw cotton. He expected
and promised much from the capture of New Orleans, but the results
were disappointing. As time went on Seward became convinced that
material interests alone would determine the attitude and action of
Great Britain and France. But the stored supplies were on hand in
the South, locked in by the blockade and would be available when
the war was over <i>provided</i> the war did not take on an
uncivilized and sanguinary character through a rising of the
slaves. If that occurred cotton would be burned and destroyed and
cotton supply to Europe would <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_95"></a>[V2:pg 95]</span> be not merely a matter of
temporary interruption, but one of long-continued dearth with no
certainty of early resumption. Fearing the growth in England,
especially, of an intention to intervene, Seward threatened a
Northern appeal to the slaves, thinking of the threat not so much
in terms of an uncivilized and horrible war as in terms of the
material interests of Great Britain. In brief, considering foreign
attitude and action in its relation to Northern advantage--to the
winning of the war--he would use emancipation as a threat of
servile insurrection, but did not desire emancipation itself for
fear it would cause that very intervention which it was his object
to prevent.</p>
<p>His instructions are wholly in line with this policy. In
February, 1862, the Confiscation Bill had been introduced in
Congress. In April, Mercier's trip to Richmond<a name=
"FNanchor897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897">[897]</a> had caused much
speculation and started many rumours in London of plans of
mediation<a name="FNanchor898"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_898">[898]</a>. On May 28, Seward wrote to Adams at
great length and especially emphasized two points: first that while
diplomats abroad had hitherto been interdicted from discussing
slavery as an issue in the war, they were now authorized to state
that the war was, in part at least, intended for the suppression of
slavery, and secondly, that the North if interfered with by foreign
nations would be forced to have recourse to a servile war. Such a
war, Seward argued, would be "completely destructive of all
European interests<a name="FNanchor899"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_899">[899]</a>...." A copy of this instruction Adams
gave to Russell on June 20. Eight days later Adams told Cobden in
reply to a query about mediation that it would result in a servile
war<a name="FNanchor900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900">[900]</a>.
Evidently Adams perfectly understood Seward's policy.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_96"></a>[V2:pg 96]</span>
<p>On July 13, Lincoln told Seward and Welles of the planned
emancipation proclamation and that this was his first mention of it
to anyone. Seward commented favourably but wished to consider the
proposal in all its bearings before committing himself<a name=
"FNanchor901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901">[901]</a>. The day
following he transmitted to agents abroad a copy of the Bill that
day introduced into Congress embodying Lincoln's plan for gradual
and compensated emancipation. This was prompt transmittal--and was
unusual. Seward sent the Bill without material comment<a name=
"FNanchor902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902">[902]</a>, but it is
apparent that this method and measure of emancipation would much
better fit in with his theory of the slavery question in relation
to foreign powers, than would an outright proclamation of
emancipation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile American anxiety as to a possible alteration in
British neutral policy was increasing. July 11, Adams reported that
he had learned "from a credible source" that the British Cabinet
might soon "take new ground<a name="FNanchor903"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_903">[903]</a>." This despatch if it reached Seward
previous to the Cabinet of July 22, presumably added strength to
his conviction of the inadvisability of now issuing the
proclamation. In that Cabinet, Seward in fact went much beyond the
customary historical statement that he advised postponement of the
proclamation until the occurrence of a Northern victory; he argued,
according to Secretary of War Stanton's notes of the meeting, "That
foreign nations will intervene to prevent the abolition of slavery
for the sake of cotton.... We break up our relations with foreign
nations and the production of cotton for sixty years<a name=
"FNanchor904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904">[904]</a>." These views
did not prevail; Lincoln merely postponed action. Ten days later
Seward sent that long instruction to Adams covering the whole
ground of feared European intervention, which, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_97"></a>[V2:pg 97]</span> fortunately,
Adams was never called upon to carry out<a name=
"FNanchor905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905">[905]</a>. In it there
was renewed the threat of a servile war if Europe attempted to aid
the South, and again it is the materialistic view that is
emphasized. Seward was clinging to his theory of correct
policy.</p>
<p>Nor was he mistaken in his view of first reactions in
governmental circles abroad--at least in England. On July 21, the
day before Lincoln's proposal of emancipation in the Cabinet,
Stuart in reviewing military prospects wrote: "Amongst the means
relied upon for weakening the South is included a servile
war<a name="FNanchor906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906">[906]</a>." To
this Russell replied: "... I have to observe that the prospect of a
servile war will only make other nations more desirous to see an
end of this desolating and destructive conflict<a name=
"FNanchor907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907">[907]</a>." This was but
brief reiteration of a more exact statement by Russell made in
comment on Seward's first hint of servile war in his despatch to
Adams of May 28, a copy of which had been given to Russell on June
20. On July 28, Russell reviewing Seward's arguments, commented on
the fast increasing bitterness of the American conflict, disturbing
and unsettling to European Governments, and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"The approach of a servile war, so much insisted upon
by Mr. Seward in his despatch, only forewarns us that another
element of destruction may be added to the slaughter, loss of
property, and waste of industry, which already afflict a country so
lately prosperous and tranquil<a name="FNanchor908"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_908">[908]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In this same despatch unfavourable comment was made also on the
Confiscation Bill with its punitive emancipation clauses. Stuart
presented a copy of the despatch to Seward <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_98"></a>[V2:pg 98]</span> on August
16<a name="FNanchor909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909">[909]</a>. On
August 22, Stuart learned of Lincoln's plan and reported it as
purely a manoeuvre to affect home politics and to frighten foreign
governments<a name="FNanchor910"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_910">[910]</a>. Where did Stuart get the news if not
from Seward, since he also reported the latter's success in
postponing the proclamation?</p>
<p>In brief both Seward and Russell were regarding emancipation in
the light of an incitement to servile insurrection, and both
believed such an event would add to the argument for foreign
intervention. The <i>threat</i> Seward had regarded as useful; the
<i>event</i> would be highly dangerous to the North. Not so,
however, did emancipation appear in prospect to American diplomats
abroad. Adams was a faithful servant in attempting to carry out the
ideas and plans of his chief, but as early as February, 1862, he
had urged a Northern declaration in regard to slavery in order to
meet in England Southern private representations that, independence
won, the South would enter upon a plan of gradual emancipation to
be applied "to all persons born after some specific date<a name=
"FNanchor911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911">[911]</a>." Motley, at
Vienna, frequently after February, 1862, in private letters to his
friends in America, urged some forward step on slavery<a name=
"FNanchor912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912">[912]</a>, but no such
advice in despatches found its way into the selected correspondence
annually sent to print by Seward. Far more important was the
determination taken by Adams, less than a month after he had
presented to Russell the "servile war" threat policy of Seward, to
give advice to his chief that the chances of foreign intervention
would be best met by the distinct avowal of an anti-slavery object
in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_99"></a>[V2:pg
99]</span> war and that the North should be prepared to meet an
European offer of mediation by declaring that if made to extinguish
slavery such mediation would be welcome. This Adams thought would
probably put an end to the mediation itself, but it would also
greatly strengthen the Northern position abroad<a name=
"FNanchor913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913">[913]</a>.</p>
<p>This was no prevision of an emancipation proclamation; but it
was assertion of the value of a higher "moral issue." Meanwhile, on
July 24, Seward still fearful of the effects abroad of
emancipation, wrote to Motley, asking whether he was "sure" that
European powers would not be encouraged in interference, because of
material interests, by a Northern attempt to free the
slaves<a name="FNanchor914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914">[914]</a>.
Motley's answer began, "A thousand times No," and Adams repeated
his plea for a moral issue<a name="FNanchor915"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_915">[915]</a>. September 25, Adams met Seward's
"material interests" argument by declaring that for Great Britain
the chief difficulty in the cotton situation was not scarcity, but
uncertainty, and that if English manufacturers could but know what
to expect there would be little "cotton pressure" on the
Government<a name="FNanchor916"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_916">[916]</a>. Thus leading diplomats abroad did not
agree with Seward, but the later advices of Adams were not yet
received when the day, September 22, arrived on which Lincoln
issued the proclamation. On that day in sending the text to Adams
the comment of Seward was brief. The proclamation, he said, put
into effect a policy the approach of which he had "heretofore
indicated to our representatives abroad," and he laid emphasis on
the idea that the main purpose of the proclamation was to convince
the South that its true interests were in the preservation of the
Union--which is to say that the hoped-for result was the return of
the South <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_100"></a>[V2:pg
100]</span> <i>with its slaves</i><a name=
"FNanchor917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917">[917]</a>. Certainly this
was far from a truthful representation, but its purpose is evident.
Seward's first thought was that having held up the threat of
servile insurrection he must now remove that bogie. Four days later
his judgment was improved, for he began, and thereafter maintained
with vigour, the "high moral purpose" argument as evinced in the
emancipation proclamation. "The interests of humanity," he wrote to
Adams, "have now become identified with the cause of our
country<a name="FNanchor918"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_918">[918]</a>...."</p>
<p>That the material interests of Great Britain were still in
Seward's thought is shown by the celerity with which under
Lincoln's orders he grasped at an unexpected opening in relation to
liberated slaves. Stuart wrote in mid-September that Mr. Walker,
secretary of the colony of British Guiana, was coming from Demerara
to Washington to secure additional labour for the British colony by
offering to carry away ex-slaves<a name="FNanchor919"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_919">[919]</a>. This scheme was no secret and five days
after the issue of the proclamation Seward proposed to Stuart a
convention by which the British Government would be permitted to
transport to the West Indies, or to any of its colonies, the
negroes about to be emancipated. On September 30, Adams was
instructed to take up the matter at London<a name=
"FNanchor920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920">[920]</a>. Russell was at
first disinclined to consider such a convention and discussion
dragged until the spring of 1864, when it was again proposed, this
time by Russell, but now declined by Seward. In its immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_101"></a>[V2:pg 101]</span>
influence in the fall of 1862, Seward's offer had no effect on the
attitude of the British Government<a name=
"FNanchor921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921">[921]</a>.</p>
<p>To Englishmen and Americans alike it has been in later years a
matter for astonishment that the emancipation proclamation did not
at once convince Great Britain of the high purposes of the North.
But if it be remembered that in the North itself the proclamation
was greeted, save by a small abolitionist faction, with doubt
extending even to bitter opposition and that British governmental
and public opinion had long dreaded a servile insurrection--even of
late taking its cue from Seward's own prophecies--the cool
reception given by the Government, the vehement and vituperative
explosions of the press do not seem so surprising. "This
Emancipation Proclamation," wrote Stuart on September 23, "seems a
brutum fulmen<a name="FNanchor922"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_922">[922]</a>." One of the President's motives, he
thought, was to affect public opinion in England. "But there is no
pretext of humanity about the Proclamation.... It is merely a
Confiscation Act, or perhaps worse, for it offers direct
encouragement to servile insurrections<a name=
"FNanchor923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923">[923]</a>." Received in
England during the Cabinet struggle over mediation the proclamation
appears not to have affected that controversy, though Russell
sought to use it as an argument for British action. In his
memorandum, circulated October 13, Russell strove to show that the
purpose and result would be servile war. He dwelt both on the
horrors of such a war, and on its destruction of industry:</p>
<blockquote>"What will be the practical effect of declaring
emancipation, not as an act of justice and beneficence, dispensed
by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_102"></a>[V2:pg 102]</span>
the Supreme Power of the State, but as an act of punishment and
retaliation inflicted by a belligerent upon a hostile community, it
is not difficult to foresee. Wherever the arms of the United States
penetrate, a premium will be given to acts of plunder, of
incendiarism, and of revenge. The military and naval authorities of
the United States will be bound by their orders to maintain and
protect the perpetrators of such acts. Wherever the invasion of the
Southern States is crowned by victory, society will be
disorganized, industry suspended, large and small proprietors of
land alike reduced to beggary<a name="FNanchor924"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_924">[924]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The London newspaper press was very nearly a unit in treating
the proclamation with derision and contempt and no other one
situation in the Civil War came in for such vigorous denunciation.
Citations setting forth such comment have frequently been gathered
together illustrative of the extent of press condemnation and of
its unity in vicious editorials<a name="FNanchor925"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_925">[925]</a>. There is no need to repeat many of them
here, but a few will indicate their tone. The <i>Times</i> greeted
the news with an assertion that this was a final desperate play by
Lincoln, as hope of victory waned. It was his "last card<a name=
"FNanchor926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926">[926]</a>," a phrase that
caught the fancy of lesser papers and was repeated by them. October
21, appeared the "strongest" of the <i>Times</i> editorials:</p>
<br>
<a name="image10.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image10.jpg"><img src=
"images/image10.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></a><br>
<b>ABE LINCOLN'S LAST CARD; OR, ROUGE-ET-NOIR.</b><br>
<i>Reproduced by permission of the Proprietors of "Punch"</i></p>
<br>
<blockquote>"... We have here the history of the beginning of the
end, but who can tell how the pages will be written which are yet
to be filled before the inevitable separation is accomplished? Are
scenes like those which we a short time since described from
Dahomey yet to interpose, and is the reign of the last PRESIDENT to
go out amid horrible massacres of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_103"></a>[V2:pg 103]</span> white women and children, to be
followed by the extermination of the black race in the South? Is
LINCOLN yet a name not known to us as it will be known to
posterity, and is it ultimately to be classed among that catalogue
of monsters, the wholesale assassins and butchers of their
kind?<br>
<br>
"... We will attempt at present to predict nothing as to what the
consequence of Mr. Lincoln's new policy may be, except that it
certainly will not have the effect of restoring the Union. It will
not deprive Mr. Lincoln of the distinctive affix which he will
share with many, for the most part foolish and incompetent, Kings
and Emperors, Caliphs and Doges, that of being LINCOLN--'the
Last.'"</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Times</i> led the way; other papers followed on. The
<i>Liverpool Post</i> thought a slave rising inevitable<a name=
"FNanchor927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927">[927]</a>, as did also
nearly every paper acknowledging anti-Northern sentiments, or
professedly neutral, while even pro-Northern journals at first
feared the same results<a name="FNanchor928"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_928">[928]</a>. Another striking phrase, "Brutum
Fulmen," ran through many editorials. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
talked of Lincoln's "cry of despair<a name=
"FNanchor929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929">[929]</a>," which was
little different from Seward's feared "last shriek."
<i>Blackwood's</i> thought the proclamation "monstrous, reckless,
devilish." It "justifies the South in raising the black flag, and
proclaiming a war without quarter<a name="FNanchor930"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_930">[930]</a>." But there is no need to expand the
citation of the well-nigh universal British press pouring out of
the wrath of heaven upon Lincoln, and his emancipation
proclamation<a name="FNanchor931"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_931">[931]</a>.</p>
<p>Even though there can be no doubt that the bulk of England at
first expected servile war to follow the proclamation it is
apparent that here and there a part of this British wrath was due
to a fear that, in spite of denials of such influence, the
proclamation was intended to arouse public opinion against projects
of intervention and <i>might so arouse it</i>. The New York
correspondent of the <i>Times</i> wrote that it was "promulgated
evidently as a sop to keep <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_104"></a>[V2:pg 104]</span> England and France quiet<a name=
"FNanchor932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932">[932]</a>," and on
October 9, an editorial asserted that Lincoln had "a very important
object. There is a presentiment in the North that recognition
cannot be delayed, and this proclamation is aimed, not at the negro
or the South, but at Europe." <i>Bell's Weekly Messenger</i>
believed that it was now "the imperative duty of England and France
to do what they can in order to prevent the possible occurrence of
a crime which, if carried out, would surpass in atrocity any
similar horror the world has ever seen<a name=
"FNanchor933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933">[933]</a>." "Historicus,"
on the other hand, asked: "What is that solution of the negro
question to which an English Government is prepared to affix the
seal of English approbation<a name="FNanchor934"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_934">[934]</a>?" Mason, the Confederate Agent in London,
wrote home that it was generally believed the proclamation was
issued "as the means of warding off recognition.... It was seen
through at once and condemned accordingly<a name=
"FNanchor935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935">[935]</a>."</p>
<p>This interpretation of Northern purpose in no sense negatives
the dictum that the proclamation exercised little influence on
immediate British governmental policy, but does offer some ground
for the belief that strong pro-Southern sympathizers at once saw
the need of combating an argument dangerous to the carrying out of
projects of mediation. Yet the new "moral purpose" of Lincoln did
not immediately appeal even to his friends. The <i>Spectator</i>
deplored the lack of a clean-cut declaration in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_105"></a>[V2:pg 105]</span> favour of the
principle of human freedom: "The principle asserted is not that a
human being cannot justly own another, but that he cannot own him
unless he is loyal to the United States." ... "There is no morality
whatever in such a decree, and if approved at all it must be upon
its merits as a political measure<a name="FNanchor936"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_936">[936]</a>." Two weeks later, reporting a public
speech at Liverpool by ex-governor Morehead of Kentucky, in which
Lincoln was accused of treachery to the border states, the
<i>Spectator</i>, while taking issue with the speaker's statements,
commented that it was not to be understood as fully defending a
system of government which chose its executive "from the ranks of
half-educated mechanics<a name="FNanchor937"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_937">[937]</a>."</p>
<p>Similarly in America the emancipation proclamation, though
loudly applauded by the abolitionists, was received with
misgivings. Lincoln was disappointed at the public reaction and
became very despondent, though this was due, in part, to the
failure of McClellan to follow up the victory of Antietam. The
elections of October and November went heavily against the
administration and largely on the alleged ground of the President's
surrender to the radicals<a name="FNanchor938"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_938">[938]</a>. The army as a whole was not favourably
stirred by the proclamation; it was considered at best as but a
useless bit of "waste paper<a name="FNanchor939"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_939">[939]</a>." In England, John Bright, the most
ardent public advocate of the Northern cause, was slow to applaud
heartily; not until December did he give distinct approval, and
even then in but half-hearted fashion, though he thought public
interest was much aroused and that attention was now fixed on
January 1, the date set by Lincoln for actual enforcement of
emancipation<a name="FNanchor940"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_940">[940]</a>. In a speech at Birmingham, December 18,
Bright had little to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_106"></a>[V2:pg 106]</span> say of emancipation; rather he
continued to use previous arguments against the South for
admitting, as Vice-President Stephens had declared, that slavery
was the very "corner-stone" of Southern institutions and
society<a name="FNanchor941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941">[941]</a>.
A few public meetings at points where favour to the North had been
shown were tried in October and November with some success but with
no great show of enthusiasm. It was not until late December that
the wind of public opinion, finding that no faintest slave-rising
had been created by the proclamation began to veer in favour of the
emancipation edict<a name="FNanchor942"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_942">[942]</a>. By the end of the year it appeared that
the Press, in holding up horrified hands and prophesying a servile
war had "overshot the mark<a name="FNanchor943"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_943">[943]</a>."</p>
<p>Soon the changing wind became a gale of public favour for the
cause of emancipation, nor was this lessened--rather increased--by
Jefferson Davis' proclamation of December 23, 1862, in which he
declared that Lincoln had approved "of the effort to excite a
servile insurrection," and that therefore it was now ordered "all
negro slaves captured in arms be at once delivered over to the
executive authorities of the respective States to which they
belong, to be dealt with according to the laws of said State." This
by state laws meant death to the slave fighting for his freedom,
even as a regular soldier in the Northern armies, and gave a good
handle for accusations of Southern ferocity<a name=
"FNanchor944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944">[944]</a>.</p>
<p>Official opinion was not readily altered, Lyons writing in
December that the promised January proclamation might still mean
servile war. He hoped that neither Lincoln's proclamation nor
Davis' threat of retaliation would be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_107"></a>[V2:pg 107]</span> carried into
effect<a name="FNanchor945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945">[945]</a>.
Russell regarded the January 1 proclamation as "a measure of war of
a very questionable kind<a name="FNanchor946"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_946">[946]</a>."</p>
<p>But the British anti-slavery public, now recovered from its
fears of an "abolition war" was of another temper. Beginning with
the last week of December, 1862, and increasing in volume in each
succeeding month, there took place meeting after meeting at which
strong resolutions were passed enthusiastically endorsing the issue
of the emancipation proclamation and pledging sympathy to the cause
of the North. The <i>Liberator</i> from week to week, listed and
commented on these public meetings, noting fifty-six held between
December 30, 1862, and March 20, 1863. The American Minister
reported even more, many of which sent to him engraved resolutions
or presented them in person through selected delegations. The
resolutions were much of the type of that adopted at Sheffield,
January 10:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Resolved</i>: that this meeting being convinced
that slavery is the cause of the tremendous struggle now going on
in the American States, and that the object of the leaders of the
rebellion is the perpetuation of the unchristian and inhuman system
of chattel slavery, earnestly prays that the rebellion may be
crushed, and its wicked object defeated, and that the Federal
Government may be strengthened to pursue its emancipation policy
till not a slave be left on the American soil<a name=
"FNanchor947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947">[947]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_108"></a>[V2:pg 108]</span>
<p>Adams quoted the <i>Times</i> as referring to these meetings as
made up of "nobodies." Adams commented:</p>
<blockquote>"They do not indeed belong to the high and noble class,
but they are just those nobodies who formerly forced their most
exalted countrymen to denounce the prosecution of the Slave Trade
by the commercial adventurers at Liverpool and Bristol, and who at
a later period overcame all their resistance to the complete
emancipation of the negro slaves in the British dependencies. If
they become once fully aroused to a sense of the importance of this
struggle as a purely moral question, I feel safe in saying there
will be an end of all effective sympathy in Great Britain with the
rebellion<a name="FNanchor948"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_948">[948]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Adams had no doubt "that these manifestations are the genuine
expression of the feelings of the religious dissenting and of the
working classes," and was confident the Government would be much
influenced by them<a name="FNanchor949"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_949">[949]</a>. The newspapers, though still editorially
unfavourable to the emancipation proclamation, accepted and printed
communications with increasing frequency in which were expressed
the same ideas as in the public meetings. This was even more
noticeable in the provincial press. Samuel A. Goddard, a merchant
of Birmingham, was a prolific letter writer to the <i>Birmingham
Post</i>, consistently upholding the Northern cause and he now
reiterated the phrase, "Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_109"></a>[V2:pg 109]</span> Lincoln's cause is just and
holy<a name="FNanchor950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950">[950]</a>."
In answer to Southern sneers at the failure of the proclamation to
touch slavery in the border states, Goddard made clear the fact
that Lincoln had no constitutional "right" to apply his edict to
states not in rebellion<a name="FNanchor951"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_951">[951]</a>. On the public platform no one equalled
the old anti-slavery orator, George Thompson, in the number of
meetings attended and addresses made. In less than a month he had
spoken twenty-one times and often in places where opposition was in
evidence. Everywhere Thompson found an aroused and encouraged
anti-slavery feeling, now strongly for the North<a name=
"FNanchor952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952">[952]</a>.</p>
<p>Eight years earlier five hundred thousand English women had
united in an address to America on behalf of the slaves. Harriet
Beecher Stowe now replied to this and asked the renewed sympathy of
her English sisters. A largely signed "round robin" letter assured
her that English women were still the foes of slavery and were
indignantly united against suggestions of British recognition of
the South<a name="FNanchor953"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_953">[953]</a>. Working class Britain was making its
voice heard in support of the North. To those of Manchester,
Lincoln, on January 19, 1863, addressed a special letter of thanks
for their earnest support while undergoing personal hardships
resulting from the disruption of industry caused by the war. "I
cannot" he wrote, "but regard your decisive utterances upon the
question [of human slavery] as an instance of sublime Christian
heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any
country<a name="FNanchor954"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_954">[954]</a>." Nonconformist England now came
vigorously to the support of the North. Spurgeon, in London, made
his great congregation pray with him: "God bless and strengthen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_110"></a>[V2:pg 110]</span>
the North; give victory to their arms<a name=
"FNanchor955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955">[955]</a>." Further and
more general expression of Nonconformist church sympathy came as a
result of a letter received February 12, 1863, from a number of
French pastors and laymen, urging all the Evangelical churches to
unite in an address to Lincoln. The London and Manchester
Emancipation Societies combined in drawing up a document for
signature by pastors and this was presented for adoption at a
meeting in Manchester on June 3, 1863. In final form it was "An
Address to Ministers and Pastors of All Christian Denominations
throughout the States of America." There was a "noisy opposition"
but the address was carried by a large majority and two
representatives, Massie and Roylance, were selected to bear the
message in person to the brethren across the ocean<a name=
"FNanchor956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956">[956]</a>. Discussion
arose over the Biblical sanction of slavery. In the <i>Times</i>
appeared an editorial pleading this sanction and arguing the
<i>duty</i> of slaves to refuse liberty<a name=
"FNanchor957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957">[957]</a>. Goldwin Smith,
Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, replied in a
pamphlet, "Does the Bible sanction American Slavery<a name=
"FNanchor958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958">[958]</a>?" His position
and his skill in presentation made him a valuable ally to the
North.</p>
<p>Thus British anti-slavery circles, previously on the defensive,
became aroused and enthusiastic when Lincoln's January 1, 1863,
proclamation made good his pledge of the previous September: other
elements of opinion, and in all classes, were strengthened in like
measure, and everywhere the first expression of fear of a servile
insurrection largely disappeared. In truth, pro-Northern England
went to such <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_111"></a>[V2:pg
111]</span> lengths in its support of emancipation as to astound
and alarm the <i>Saturday Review</i>, which called these
demonstrations a "carnival of cant<a name=
"FNanchor959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959">[959]</a>." More neutral
minds were perplexed over the practical difficulties and might well
agree with Schleiden who wrote in January, 1863, quoting
Machiavelli: "What is more difficult, to make free men slaves, or
slaves free<a name="FNanchor960"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_960">[960]</a>?" But by the end of January the popular
approval of emancipation was in full swing. On the evening of the
twenty-ninth there took place in London at Exeter Hall, a great
mass meeting unprecedented in attendance and enthusiasm. The
meeting had been advertised for seven o'clock, but long before the
hour arrived the hall was jammed and the corridors filled. A second
meeting was promptly organized for the lower hall, but even so the
people seeking admission crowded Exeter Street and seriously
impeded traffic in the Strand. Outdoor meetings listened to reports
of what was going on in the Hall and cheered the speakers. The main
address was made by the Rev. Newman Hall, of Surrey Chapel. A few
Southern sympathizers who attempted to heckle the speakers were
quickly shouted down<a name="FNanchor961"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_961">[961]</a>.</p>
<p>The "carnival of cant," as the <i>Saturday Review</i> termed it,
was truly a popular demonstration, stirred by anti-slavery leaders,
but supported by the working and non-enfranchised classes. Its
first effect was to restore courage and confidence to Northern
supporters in the upper classes. Bright had welcomed emancipation,
yet with some misgivings. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_112"></a>[V2:pg 112]</span> He now joined in the movement
and in a speech at Rochdale, February 3, on "Slavery and
Secession," gave full approval of Lincoln's efforts.</p>
<p>In 1862, shortly after the appearance of Spence's <i>American
Union</i>, which had been greeted with great interest in England
and had influenced largely upper-class attitude in favour of the
South, Cairnes had published his pamphlet, "Slave Power." This was
a reasoned analysis of the basis of slavery and a direct challenge
to the thesis of Spence<a name="FNanchor962"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_962">[962]</a>. England's "unnatural infatuation" for a
slave power, Cairnes prophesied, would be short-lived. His pamphlet
began to be read with more conviction by that class which until now
had been coldly neutral and which wished a more reassured faith in
the Northern cause than that stirred by the emotional reception
given the emancipation proclamation. Yet at bottom it was
emancipation that brought this reasoning public to seek in such
works as that of Cairnes a logical basis for a change of heart.
Even in official circles, utterances previously made in private
correspondence, or in governmental conversations only, were now
ventured in public by friends of the North. On April 1, 1863, at a
banquet given to Palmerston in Edinburgh, the Duke of Argyll
ventured to answer a reference made by Palmerston in a speech of
the evening previous in which had been depicted the horrors of
Civil War, by asking if Scotland were historically in a position to
object to civil wars having high moral purpose. "I, for one,"
Argyll said, "have not learned to be ashamed of that ancient
combination of the Bible and the sword. Let it be enough for us to
pray and hope that the contest, whenever it may be brought to an
end, shall bring with it that great blessing to the white race
which shall consist in the final freedom of the black<a name=
"FNanchor963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963">[963]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_113"></a>[V2:pg 113]</span>
<p>The public meetings in England raised high the hope in America
that governmental England would show some evidence of a more
friendly attitude. Lincoln himself drafted a resolution embodying
the ideas he thought it would be wise for the public meetings to
adopt. It read:</p>
<blockquote>"Whereas, while <i>heretofore</i> States, and Nations,
have tolerated slavery, <i>recently</i>, for the first time in the
world, an attempt has been made to construct a new Nation, upon the
basis of, and with the primary, and fundamental object to maintain,
enlarge, and perpetuate human slavery, therefore,<br>
<br>
<i>Resolved</i>: that no such embryo State should ever be
recognized by, or admitted into, the family of Christian and
civilized nations; and that all Christian and civilized men
everywhere should, by all lawful means, resist to the utmost, such
recognition or admission<a name="FNanchor964"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_964">[964]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This American hope much disturbed Lyons. On his return to
Washington, in November, 1862, he had regarded the emancipation
proclamation as a political manoeuvre purely and an unsuccessful
one. The administration he thought was losing ground and the people
tired of the war. This was the burden of his private letters to
Russell up to March, 1863, but does not appear in his official
despatches in which there was nothing to give offence to Northern
statesmen. But in March, Lyons began to doubt the correctness of
these judgments. He notes a renewed Northern enthusiasm leading to
the conferring of extreme powers--the so-called "dictatorship
measures"--upon Lincoln. Wise as Lyons ordinarily was he was bound
by the social and educational traditions of his class, and had at
first not the slightest conception of the force or effect of
emancipation upon the public in middle-class England. He feared an
American reaction against England when it was understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_114"></a>[V2:pg 114]</span>
that popular meetings would have no influence on the British
Government.</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Seward and the whole Party calculate immensely on
the effects of the anti-slavery meetings in England, and seem to
fancy that public feeling in England is coming so completely round
to the North that the Government will be obliged to favour the
North in all ways, even if it be disinclined to do so. This notion
is unlucky, as it makes those who hold it, unreasonable and
presumptuous in dealing with us<a name="FNanchor965"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_965">[965]</a>."</blockquote>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Lincoln's plan of emancipation and his first proclamation had
little relation to American foreign policy. Seward's attitude
toward emancipation was that the <i>threat</i> of it and of a
possible servile war might be useful in deterring foreign nations,
especially Great Britain, from intervening. But he objected to the
carrying of emancipation into effect because he feared it would
<i>induce</i> intervention. Servile war, in part by Seward's own
efforts, in part because of earlier British newspaper speculations,
was strongly associated with emancipation, in the English view.
Hence the Government received the September, 1862, proclamation
with disfavour, the press with contempt, and the public with
apprehension--even the friends of the North. But no servile war
ensued. In January, 1863, Lincoln kept his promise of wide
emancipation and the North stood committed to a high moral object.
A great wave of relief and exultation <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_115"></a>[V2:pg 115]</span> swept over
anti-slavery England, but did not so quickly extend to governmental
circles. It was largely that England which was as yet without
direct influence on Parliament which so exulted and now upheld the
North. Could this England of the people affect governmental policy
and influence its action toward America? Lyons correctly
interpreted the North and Seward as now more inclined to press the
British Government on points previously glossed over, and in the
same month in which Lyons wrote this opinion there was coming to a
head a controversy over Britain's duty as a neutral, which both
during the war and afterwards long seemed to Americans a serious
and distinctly unfriendly breach of British neutrality. This was
the building in British ports of Confederate naval vessels of
war.</p>

the principle of individual liberty," but as issued they could only
mean "the hope of stirring a servile war in the South."

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE LAIRD RAMS</h3>
<br>
<p>The building in British ports of Confederate war vessels like
the <i>Alabama</i> and the subsequent controversy and arbitration
in relation thereto have been exhaustively studied and discussed
from every aspect of legal responsibility, diplomatic relations,
and principles of international law. There is no need and no
purpose here to review in detail these matters. The purpose is,
rather, to consider the development and effect at the time of their
occurrence of the principal incidents related to Southern
ship-building in British yards. The <i>intention</i> of the British
Government is of greater importance in this study than the
correctness of its action.</p>
<p>Yet it must first be understood that the whole question of a
belligerent's right to procure ships of war or to build them in the
ports of neutral nations was, in 1860, still lacking definite
application in international law. There were general principles
already established that the neutral must not do, nor permit its
subjects to do, anything directly in aid of belligerents. The
British Foreign Enlistment Act, notification of which had been
given in May, 1861, forbade subjects to "be concerned in the
equipping, furnishing, fitting out, or arming, of any ship or
vessel, with intent or in order that such ship or vessel shall be
employed in the service ..." of a belligerent, and provided for
punishment of individuals and forfeiture of vessels if this
prohibition were disobeyed. But the Act also declared that such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_117"></a>[V2:pg 117]</span>
punishment, or seizure, would follow on due proof of the offence.
Here was the weak point of the Act, for in effect if secrecy were
maintained by offenders the proof was available only after the
offence had been committed and one of the belligerents injured by
the violation of the law. Over twenty years earlier the American
Government, seeking to prevent its subjects from committing
unneutral acts in connection with the Canadian rebellion of 1837,
had realized the weakness of its neutrality laws as they then
stood, and by a new law of March 10, 1838, hastily passed and
therefore limited to two years' duration, in the expectation of a
more perfect law, but intended as a clearer exposition of neutral
duty, had given federal officials power to act and seize <i>on
suspicion</i>, leaving the proof of guilt or innocence to be
determined later. But the British interpretation of her own
neutrality laws was that proof was required in advance of
seizure--an interpretation wholly in line with the basic principle
that a man was innocent until proved guilty, but fatal to that
preservation of strict neutrality which Great Britain had so
promptly asserted at the beginning of the Civil War<a name=
"FNanchor966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966">[966]</a>.</p>
<p>The South wholly lacking a navy or the means to create one,
early conceived the idea of using neutral ports for <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_118"></a>[V2:pg 118]</span> the
construction of war vessels. Advice secured from able British
lawyers was to the effect that if care were taken to observe the
strict letter of the Foreign Enlistment Act, by avoiding warlike
equipment, a ship, even though her construction were such as to
indicate that she was destined to become a ship of war, might be
built by private parties in British yards. The three main points
requiring careful observance by the South were concealment of
government ownership and destination, no war equipment and no
enlistment of crew in British waters.</p>
<p>The principal agent selected by the South to operate on these
lines was Captain J.D. Bullock, who asserts in his book descriptive
of his work that he never violated British neutrality law and that
prevailing legal opinion in England supported him in this
view<a name="FNanchor967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967">[967]</a>. In
March, 1862, the steamer <i>Oreto</i> cleared from Liverpool with a
declared destination of "Palermo, the Mediterranean, and Jamaica."
She was not heard of until three months later when she was reported
to be at Nassau completing her equipment as a Southern war vessel.
In June, Adams notified Russell "that a new and still more powerful
war-steamer was nearly ready for departure from the port of
Liverpool on the same errand<a name="FNanchor968"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_968">[968]</a>." He protested that such ships violated
the neutrality of Great Britain and demanded their stoppage and
seizure. From June 23 to July 28, when this second ship, "No. 290"
(later christened the <i>Alabama</i>) left Liverpool, Adams and the
United States consul at Liverpool, Dudley, were busy in securing
evidence and in renewing protests to the Government. To each
protest Russell replied in but a few lines that the matter had been
referred to the proper departments, and it was not until July 26,
when there was received from Adams an opinion by an eminent Queen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_119"></a>[V2:pg 119]</span>
Counsel, Collier, that the affidavits submitted were conclusive
against the "290," that Russell appears to have been seriously
concerned. On July 28, the law officers of the Crown were asked for
an immediate opinion, and on the thirty-first telegrams were sent
to Liverpool and to other ports to stop and further examine the
vessel. But the "290" was well away and outside of British
waters<a name="FNanchor969"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_969">[969]</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Alabama</i>, having received guns and munitions by a
ship, the <i>Bahama</i>, sent out from England to that end, and
having enlisted in the Confederate Navy most of the British crews
of the two vessels, now entered upon a career of destruction of
Northern commerce. She was not a privateer, as she was commonly
called at the time, but a Government vessel of war specially
intended to capture and destroy merchant ships. In short her true
character, in terms of modern naval usage, was that of a "commerce
destroyer." Under an able commander, Captain Semmes, she traversed
all oceans, captured merchant ships and after taking coal and
stores from them, sank or burnt the captures; for two years she
evaded battle with Northern war vessels and spread so wide a fear
that an almost wholesale transfer of the flag from American to
British or other foreign register took place, in the mercantile
marine. The career of the <i>Alabama</i> was followed with
increasing anger and chagrin by the North; this, said the public,
was a British ship, manned by a British crew, using British guns
and ammunition, whose escape from Liverpool had been winked at by
the British Government. What further evidence was necessary of bad
faith in a professed strict neutrality?</p>
<p>Nor were American officials far behind the public in suspicion
and anger. At the last moment it had appeared <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_120"></a>[V2:pg 120]</span> as if the
Government were inclined to stop the "290." Was the hurried
departure of the vessel due to a warning received from official
sources? On November 21, Adams reported that Russell complained in
an interview of remarks made privately by Bright, to the effect
that warning had come from Russell himself, and "seemed to me a
little as if he suspected that Mr. Bright had heard this from
me<a name="FNanchor970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970">[970]</a>."
Adams disavowed, and sincerely, any such imputation, but at the
same time expressed to Russell his conviction that there must have
been from some source a "leak" of the Government's
intention<a name="FNanchor971"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_971">[971]</a>. The question of advance warning to
Bullock, or to the Lairds who built the <i>Alabama</i>, was not one
which was likely to be officially put forward in any case; the real
issue was whether an offence to British neutrality law had been
committed, whether it would be acknowledged as such, and still more
important, whether repetitions of the offence would be permitted.
The <i>Alabama</i>, even though she might, as the American
assistant-secretary of the Navy wrote, be "giving us a sick
turn<a name="FNanchor972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972">[972]</a>,"
could not by herself greatly affect the issue of the war; but many
<i>Alabamas</i> would be a serious matter. The belated governmental
order to stop the vessel was no assurance for the future since in
reply to Adams' protests after her escape, and to a prospective
claim for damages, Russell replied that in fact the orders to stop
had been given merely for the purpose of further investigation, and
that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_121"></a>[V2:pg
121]</span> in strict law there had been no neglect of governmental
duty<a name="FNanchor973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973">[973]</a>. If
this were so similar precautions and secrecy would prohibit
official interference in the issue from British ports of a whole
fleet of Southern war-vessels. Russell might himself feel that a
real offence to the North had taken place. He might write, "I
confess the proceedings of that vessel [the <i>Alabama</i>] are
enough to <i>rile</i> a more temperate nation, and I owe a grudge
to the Liverpool people on that account<a name=
"FNanchor974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974">[974]</a>," but this was
of no value to the North if the governmental decision was against
interference without complete and absolute proof.</p>
<p>It was therefore the concern of the North to find some means of
bringing home to the British Ministry the enormity of the offence
in American eyes and the serious danger to good relations if such
offences were to be continued. An immediate downright threat of war
would have been impolitic and would have stirred British pride to
the point of resentment. Yet American pride was aroused also and it
was required of Seward that he gain the Northern object and yet
make no such threat as would involve the two nations in war--a
result that would have marked the success of Southern secession.
That Seward was able to find the way in which to do this is
evidence of that fertility of imagination and gift in expedient
which marked his whole career in the diplomacy of the Civil
War<a name="FNanchor975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975">[975]</a>.</p>
<p>In that same month when Adams was beginning his protests on the
"290," June, 1862, there had already been drawn the plans, and the
contracts made with the Laird <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_122"></a>[V2:pg 122]</span> Brothers at Liverpool, for the
building of two vessels far more dangerous than the <i>Alabama</i>
to the Northern cause. These were the so-called Laird Rams. They
were to be two hundred and thirty feet long, have a beam of forty
feet, be armoured with four and one-half inch iron plate and be
provided with a "piercer" at the prow, about seven feet long and of
great strength. This "piercer" caused the ships to be spoken of as
rams, and when the vessels were fully equipped it was expected the
"piercer" would be three feet under the surface of the water. This
was the distinguishing feature of the two ships; it was unusual
construction, nearly impossible of use in an ordinary battle at
sea, but highly dangerous to wooden ships maintaining a close
blockade at some Southern port. While there was much newspaper
comment in England that the vessels were "new <i>Alabamas</i>," and
in America that they were "floating fortresses," suitable for
attack upon defenceless Northern cities, their primary purpose was
to break up the blockading squadrons<a name=
"FNanchor976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976">[976]</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly before the escape of the <i>Alabama</i> and at a time
when there was but little hope the British Government would seize
her and shortly after the news was received in Washington that
still other vessels were planned for building in the Lairds' yards,
a Bill was introduced in Congress authorizing the President to
issue letters of marque and privateering. This was in July, 1862,
and on the twelfth, Seward wrote to Adams of the proposed measure
specifying that the purpose was to permit privateers to seek for
and capture or destroy the <i>Alabama</i> or other vessels of a
like type. He characterized this as a plan "to organize the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_123"></a>[V2:pg 123]</span>
militia of the seas by issuing letters of marque and
reprisal<a name="FNanchor977"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_977">[977]</a>." Neither here nor at any time did Seward
or Adams allege in diplomatic correspondence any other purpose than
the pursuit of <i>Alabamas</i>, nor is it presumable that in July,
1862, the construction plans of the Rams were sufficiently well
known to the North to warrant a conclusion that the later purpose
of the proposed privateering fleet was <i>at first</i> quite other
than the alleged purpose. Probably the Bill introduced in July,
1862, was but a hasty reaction to the sailing of the <i>Oreto</i>
(or <i>Florida</i>) and to the failure of early protests in the
case of the <i>Alabama</i>. Moreover there had been an earlier
newspaper agitation for an increase of naval power by the creation
of a "militia of the seas," though with no clear conception of
definite objects to be attained. This agitation was now renewed and
reinforced and many public speeches made by a General Hiram
Wallbridge, who had long advocated an organization of the
mercantile marine as an asset in times of war<a name=
"FNanchor978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978">[978]</a>. But though
introduced in the summer of 1862, the "privateering bill" was not
seriously taken up until February, 1863.</p>
<p>In the Senate discussion of the Bill at the time of
introduction, Senator Grimes, its sponsor, declared that the object
was to encourage privateers to pursue British ships when, as was
expected, they should "turn Confederate." Sumner objected that the
true business of privateers was to destroy enemy commerce and that
the South had no such <i>bona fide</i> commerce. Grimes agreed that
this was his opinion also, but explained that the administration
wanted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_124"></a>[V2:pg
124]</span> the measure passed so that it might have in its hands a
power to be used if the need arose. The general opinion of the
Senate was opposed and the matter was permitted to lapse, but
without definite action, so that it could at any time be called up
again<a name="FNanchor979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979">[979]</a>.
Six months later the progress of construction and the purpose of
the rams at Liverpool were common knowledge. On January 7, 1863,
the privateering bill again came before the Senate, was referred to
the committee on naval affairs, reported out, and on February 17
was passed and sent to the House of Representatives, where on March
2 it was given a third reading and passed without debate<a name=
"FNanchor980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980">[980]</a>. In the Senate,
Grimes now clearly stated that the Bill was needed because the
Confederates "are now building in England a fleet of vessels
designed to break our blockade of their coast," and that the
privateers were to "assist in maintaining blockades." There was no
thorough debate but a few perfunctory objections were raised to
placing so great a power in the hands of the President, while
Sumner alone appears as a consistent opponent arguing that the
issue of privateers would be dangerous to the North since it might
lead to an unwarranted interference with neutral commerce. No
speaker outlined the exact method by which privateers were to be
used in "maintaining blockades"; the bill was passed as an
"administration measure."</p>
<p>Coincidently, but as yet unknown in Washington, the chagrin of
Russell at the escape of the <i>Alabama</i> had somewhat lost its
edge. At first he had been impressed with the necessity of amending
the Foreign Enlistment Act so as to prevent similar offences and
had gained the approval of the law officers of the Crown. Russell
had even offered to take up with America an agreement by which both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_125"></a>[V2:pg 125]</span>
countries were to amend their neutrality laws at the same moment.
This was in December, 1862, but now on February 14, 1863, he wrote
to Lyons that the project of amendment had been abandoned as the
Cabinet saw no way of improving the law<a name=
"FNanchor981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981">[981]</a>. While this
letter to Lyons was on its way to America, a letter from Seward was
<i>en route</i>, explaining to Adams the meaning of the
privateering bill.</p>
<p>"The Senate has prepared a Bill which confers upon the President
of the United States the power to grant letters of marque and
reprisal in any war in which the country may at any time be
engaged, and it is expected that the Bill will become a law. Lord
Lyons suggests that the transaction may possibly be misapprehended
abroad, if it come upon foreign powers suddenly and without any
explanations. You will be at liberty to say that, as the Bill
stands, the executive Government will be set at liberty to put the
law in force in its discretion, and that thus far the proper policy
in regard to the exercise of that discretion has not engaged the
President's attention. I have had little hesitation in saying to
Lord Lyons that if no extreme circumstances occur, there will be
entire frankness on the part of the Government in communicating to
him upon the subject, so far as to avoid any surprise on the part
of friendly nations, whose commerce or navigation it might be
feared would be incidentally and indirectly affected, if it shall
be found expedient to put the Act in force against the insurgents
of the United States<a name="FNanchor982"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_982">[982]</a>."</p>
<p>Certainly this was vague explanation, yet though the main object
might be asserted "to put the act in force against the insurgents,"
the hint was given that the commerce of friendly neutrals might be
"incidentally and indirectly affected." And so both Lyons and
Seward understood the matter, for on February 24, Lyons reported a
long conversation with Seward in which after pointing out the
probable "bad effect" on Europe, Lyons received the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_126"></a>[V2:pg 126]</span> reply that
some remedy must be found for the fact that "the law did not appear
to enable the British Government to prevent" the issue of
Confederate "privateers<a name="FNanchor983"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_983">[983]</a>." On March 8, Seward followed this up by
sending to Lyons an autograph letter:</p>
<blockquote>"I am receiving daily such representations from our
sea-ports concerning the depredations on our commerce committed by
the vessels built and practically fitted out in England, that I do
most sincerely apprehend a new element is entering into the unhappy
condition of affairs, which, with all the best dispositions of your
Government and my own, cannot long be controlled to the
preservation of peace.<br>
<br>
<p>"If you think well of it, I should like that you should
confidentially inform Earl Russell that the departure of more armed
vessels under insurgent-rebel command from English ports is a thing
to be deprecated above all things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 9th, Lyons had a long talk with Seward about this, and
it appears that Lincoln had seen the letter and approved it. Seward
stated that the New York Chamber of Commerce had protested about
the <i>Alabama</i>, declaring:</p>
<blockquote>"That no American merchant vessels would get
freights--that even war with England was preferable to this--that
in that case the maritime enterprise of the country would at least
find a profitable employment in cruising against British
trade."</blockquote>
<p>Seward went on to show the necessity of letters of marque, and
Lyons protested vigorously and implied that war must result.</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Seward said that he was well aware of the
inconvenience not to say the danger of issuing Letters of Marque:
that he should be glad to delay doing so, or to escape the
necessity altogether; but that really unless some intelligence came
from England to allay the public exasperation, the measure would be
unavoidable<a name="FNanchor984"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_984">[984]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_127"></a>[V2:pg 127]</span>
<p>Lyons was much alarmed, writing that the feeling in the North
must not be underestimated and pointing out that the newspapers
were dwelling on the notion that under British interpretation of
her duty as a neutral Mexico, if she had money, could build ships
in British ports to cruise in destruction of French commerce,
adding that "one might almost suppose" some rich American would
give the funds to Mexico for the purpose and so seek to involve
England in trouble with France<a name="FNanchor985"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_985">[985]</a>. Lyons had also been told by Seward in
their conversation of March 9, that on that day an instruction had
been sent to Adams to present to Russell the delicacy of the
situation and to ask for some assurance that no further Southern
vessels of war should escape from British ports. This instruction
presented the situation in more diplomatic language but in no
uncertain tone, yet still confined explanation of the privateering
bill as required to prevent the "destruction of our national
navigating interest, unless that calamity can be prevented by ...
the enforcement of the neutrality law of Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986">[986]</a>...."</p>
<p>Lyons' reports reached Russell before Seward's instruction was
read to him. Russell had already commented to Adams that American
privateers would find no Confederate merchant ships and that if
they interfered with neutral commerce the United States Government
would be put in an awkward position. To this Adams replied that the
privateers would seek and capture, if possible, vessels like the
<i>Alabama</i>, but Russell asked Lyons to find out "whether in any
case they [privateers] will be authorized to interfere with neutral
commerce, and if in any case in what case, and to what
extent<a name="FNanchor987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987">[987]</a>."
Three days later, on March 26, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_128"></a>[V2:pg 128]</span> Adams presented his instructions
and these Russell regarded as "not unfriendly in tone," but in the
long conversation that ensued the old result was reached that Adams
declared Great Britain negligent in performance of neutral duty,
while Russell professed eagerness to stop Southern shipbuilding if
full evidence was "forthcoming." Adams concluded that "he had
worked to the best of his power for peace, but it had become a most
difficult task." Upon this Russell commented to Lyons, "Mr. Adams
fully deserves the character of having always laboured for peace
between our two Nations. Nor I trust will his efforts, and those of
the two Governments fail of success<a name=
"FNanchor988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988">[988]</a>."</p>
<p>In these last days of March matters were in fact rapidly drawing
to a head both in America and England. At Washington, from March
seventh to the thirty-first, the question of issuing letters of
marque and reprisal had been prominently before the Cabinet and
even Welles who had opposed them was affected by unfavourable
reports received from Adams as to the intentions of Great Britain.
The final decision was to wait later news from England<a name=
"FNanchor989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989">[989]</a>. This was
Seward's idea as he had not as yet received reports of the British
reaction to his communications through Lyons and Adams. March 27
was the critical day of decision in London, as it was also the day
upon which public and parliamentary opinion was most vigorously
debated in regard to Great Britain's neutral duty. Preceding this
other factors of influence were coming to the front. In the first
days of March, Slidell, at Paris, had received semi-official
assurances that if the South wished to build ships in French yards
"we should be permitted to arm and equip them and proceed to
sea<a name="FNanchor990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990">[990]</a>."
This suggestion was permitted to percolate in England with the
intention, no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_129"></a>[V2:pg
129]</span> doubt, of strengthening Bullock's position there. In
the winter of 1862-3, orders had been sent to the Russian Baltic
fleet to cruise in western waters and there was first a suspicion
in America, later a conviction, that the purpose of this cruise was
distinctly friendly to the North--that the orders might even extend
to actual naval aid in case war should arise with England and
France. In March, 1863, this was but vague rumour, by midsummer it
was a confident hope, by September-October, when Russian fleets had
entered the harbours of New York and San Francisco, the rumour had
become a conviction and the silence of Russian naval officers when
banqueted and toasted was regarded as discreet confirmation. There
was no truth in the rumour, but already in March curious surmises
were being made even in England, as to Russian intentions, though
there is no evidence that the Government was at all concerned. The
truth was that the Russian fleet had been ordered to sea as a
precaution against easy destruction in Baltic waters, in case the
difficulties developing in relation to Poland should lead to war
with France and England<a name="FNanchor991"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_991">[991]</a>.</p>
<p>In England, among the people rather than in governmental
England, a feeling was beginning to manifest itself that the
Ministry had been lax in regard to the <i>Alabama</i>, and as news
of her successes was received this feeling was given voice.
Liverpool, at first almost wholly on the side of the Lairds and of
Southern ship-building, became doubtful <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_130"></a>[V2:pg 130]</span> by the very
ease with which the <i>Alabama</i> destroyed Northern ships.
Liverpool merchants looked ahead and saw that their interests
might, after all, be directly opposed to those of the
ship-builders. Meetings were held and the matter discussed. In
February, 1863, such a meeting at Plaistow, attended by the gentry
of the neighbourhood, but chiefly by working men, especially by
dock labourers and by men from the ship-building yards at
Blackwall, resolved that "the Chairman be requested to write to the
Prime Minister of our Queen, earnestly entreating him to put in
force, with utmost vigilance, the law of England against such ships
as the <i>Alabama</i><a name="FNanchor992"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_992">[992]</a>." Such expressions were not as yet
widespread, nor did the leading papers, up to April, indulge in
much discussion, but British <i>doubt</i> was developing<a name=
"FNanchor993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993">[993]</a>.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, Russell himself was experiencing a renewed doubt
as to Britain's neutral duty. On March 23, he made a speech in
Parliament which Adams reported as "the most satisfactory of all
the speeches he has made <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_131"></a>[V2:pg 131]</span> since I have been at this
post<a name="FNanchor994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994">[994]</a>."
On March 26, came the presentation by Adams of Seward's instruction
of which Russell wrote to Lyons as made in no unfriendly tone and
as a result of which Adams wrote: "The conclusion which I draw ...
is, that the Government is really better disposed to exertion, and
feels itself better sustained for action by the popular sentiment
than ever before<a name="FNanchor995"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_995">[995]</a>." Russell told Adams that he had received
a note from Palmerston "expressing his approbation of every word"
of his speech three days before. In a portion of the despatch to
Seward, not printed in the Diplomatic Correspondence, Adams advised
against the issue of privateers, writing, "In the present
favourable state of popular mind, it scarcely seems advisable to
run the risk of changing the current in Great Britain by the
presentation of a new issue which might rally all national pride
against us as was done in the <i>Trent</i> case<a name=
"FNanchor996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996">[996]</a>." That Russell
was indeed thinking of definite action is foreshadowed by the
advice he gave to Palmerston on March 27, as to the latter's
language in the debate scheduled for that day on the Foreign
Enlistment Act. Russell wrote, referring to the interview with
Adams:</p>
<blockquote>"The only thing which Adams could think of when I asked
him what he had to propose in reference to the <i>Alabama</i> was
that the Government should declare their disapproval of the fitting
out of such ships of war to prey on American commerce.<br>
<br>
"Now, as the fitting out and escape of the <i>Alabama</i> and
<i>Oreto</i> was clearly an evasion of our law, I think you can
have no difficulty in declaring this evening that the Government
disapprove of all such attempts to elude our law with a view to
assist one of the belligerents<a name="FNanchor997"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_997">[997]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_132"></a>[V2:pg 132]</span>
<p>But the tone of parliamentary debate did not bear out the
hopeful view of the American Minister. It was, as Bright wrote to
Sumner, "badly managed and told against us<a name=
"FNanchor998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998">[998]</a>," and Bright
himself participated in this "bad management." For over a year he
had been advocating the cause of the North in public speeches and
everywhere pointing out to unenfranchised England that the victory
of the North was essential to democracy in all Europe. Always an
orator of power he used freely vigorous language and nowhere more
so than in a great public meeting of the Trades Unions of London in
St. James' Hall, on March 26, the evening before the parliamentary
debate. The purpose of this meeting was to bring public pressure on
the Government in favour of the North, and the pith of Bright's
speech was to contrast the democratic instincts of working men with
the aristocratic inclinations of the Government<a name=
"FNanchor999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999">[999]</a>. Reviewing
"aristocratic" attitude toward the Civil War, Bright said:</p>
<blockquote>"Privilege thinks it has a great interest in this
contest, and every morning, with blatant voice, it comes into your
streets and curses the American Republic. Privilege has beheld an
afflicting spectacle for many years past. It has beheld thirty
millions of men, happy and prosperous, without emperor, without
king, without the surroundings of a court, without nobles, except
such as are made by eminence in intellect and virtue, without State
bishops and State priests.<br>
<br>
"'Sole venders of the lore which works salvation,' without great
armies and great navies, without great debt and without great
taxes.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"You wish the freedom of your country. You wish it for
yourselves.... Do not then give the hand of fellowship to the worst
foes of freedom that the world has ever seen.... You will not do
this. I have faith in you. Impartial history <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_133"></a>[V2:pg 133]</span> will tell
that, when your statesmen were hostile or coldly neutral, when many
of your rich men were corrupt, when your press--which ought to have
instructed and defended--was mainly written to betray, the fate of
a Continent and of its vast population being in peril, you clung to
freedom with an unfailing trust that God in his infinite mercy will
yet make it the heritage of all His children<a name=
"FNanchor1000"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1000">[1000]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The public meeting of March 26 was the most notable one in
support of the North held throughout the whole course of the war,
and it was also the most notable one as indicating the rising tide
of popular demand for more democratic institutions. That it
irritated the Government and gave a handle to Southern sympathizers
in the parliamentary debate of March 27 is unquestioned. In
addition, if that debate was intended to secure from the Government
an intimation of future policy against Southern shipbuilding it was
conducted on wrong lines for <i>immediate</i> effect--though
friends of the North may have thought the method used was wise for
<i>future</i> effect. This method was vigorous attack. Forster,
leading in the debate<a name="FNanchor1001"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1001">[1001]</a>, called on Ministers to explain the
"flagrant" violation of the Foreign Enlistment Act, and to offer
some pledge for the future; he asserted that the Government should
have been active on its own initiative in seeking evidence instead
of waiting to be urged to enforce the law, and he even hinted at a
certain degree of complicity in the escape of the <i>Alabama</i>.
The Solicitor-General answered in a legal defence of the
Government, complained of the offence of America in arousing its
citizens against Great Britain upon unjustifiable grounds, but did
not make so vigorous a reply as might, perhaps, have been expected.
Still he stood firmly on the ground that the Government could not
act without evidence to convict--in itself a statement that might
well preclude <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_134"></a>[V2:pg
134]</span> interference with the Rams. Bright accused the
Government of a "cold and unfriendly neutrality," and referred at
length to the public meeting of the previous evening:</p>
<blockquote>"If you had last night looked in the faces of three
thousand of the most intelligent of the artisan classes in London,
as I did, and heard their cheers, and seen their sympathy for that
country for which you appear to care so little, you would imagine
that the more forbearing, the more generous, and the more just the
conduct of the Government to the United States, the more it would
recommend itself to the magnanimous feelings of the people of this
country."</blockquote>
<p>This assumption of direct opposition between Parliament and the
people was not likely to win or to convince men, whether
pro-Southern or not, who were opponents of the speaker's
long-avowed advocacy of more democratic institutions in England. It
is no wonder then that Laird, who had been castigated in the
speeches of the evening, rising in defence of the conduct of his
firm, should seek applause by declaring, "I would rather be handed
down to posterity as the builder of a dozen <i>Alabamas</i> than as
a man who applies himself deliberately to set class against class,
and to cry up the institutions of another country which, when they
come to be tested, are of no value whatever, and which reduce the
very name of liberty to an utter absurdity." This utterance was
greeted with great cheering--shouted not so much in approval of the
<i>Alabama</i> as in approval of the speaker's defiance of
Bright.</p>

<br>
<p>In short, the friends of the North, if they sought some
immediate pledge by the Government, had gone the wrong way about to
secure it. Vigour in attack was no way to secure a favourable
response from Palmerston. Always a fighting politician in public it
was inevitable that he should now fight back. Far from making the
statement recommended to him by Russell, he concluded the debate by
reasserting the correctness of governmental procedure in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_135"></a>[V2:pg 135]</span>
the case of the <i>Alabama</i>, and himself with vigour accused
Forster and Bright of speaking in such a way as to increase rather
than allay American irritation. Yet a careful reading of the
speeches of both the Solicitor-General and of Palmerston, shows
that while vindicating the Government's conduct in the past, they
were avoiding <i>any</i> pledge of whatever nature, for the
future.</p>
<p>Adams was clearly disappointed and thought that the result of
the debate was "rather to undo in the popular mind the effect of
Lord Russell's speech than to confirm it<a name=
"FNanchor1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002">[1002]</a>." He and his
English advisers were very uneasy, not knowing whether to trust to
Russell's intimations of more active governmental efforts, or to
accept the conclusion that his advice had been rejected by
Palmerston<a name="FNanchor1003"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1003">[1003]</a>. Possibly if less anxious and alarmed
they would have read more clearly between the lines of
parliamentary utterances and have understood that their failure to
hurry the Government into public announcement of a new policy was
no proof that old policy would be continued. Disappointed at the
result in Parliament, they forgot that the real pressure on
Government was coming from an American declaration of an intention
to issue privateers unless something were done to satisfy that
country. Certainly Russell was unmoved by the debate for on April 3
he wrote to Palmerston:</p>
<blockquote>"The conduct of the gentlemen who have contracted for
the ironclads at Birkenhead is so very suspicious that I have
thought it necessary to direct that they should be detained. The
Attorney-General has been consulted and concurs in the measure, as
one of policy, though not of strict law.<br>
<br>
"We shall thus test the law, and if we have to pay damages we have
satisfied the opinion which prevails here <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_136"></a>[V2:pg 136]</span> as well as in
America that this kind of neutral hostility should not be allowed
to go on without some attempt to stop it<a name=
"FNanchor1004"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1004">[1004]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Two days later, on April 5, the <i>Alexandra</i>, a vessel being
equipped to join the <i>Alabama</i> as a commerce destroyer, was
seized on the ground that she was about to violate the Enlistment
Act and a new policy, at least to make a test case in law, was
thereby made public. In fact, on March 30, but three days after the
debate of March 27, the case of the <i>Alexandra</i> had been taken
up by Russell, referred to the law officers on March 31, and
approved by them for seizure on April 4<a name=
"FNanchor1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005">[1005]</a>. Public
meetings were quickly organized in support of the Government's
action, as that in Manchester on April 6, when six thousand people
applauded the seizure of the <i>Alexandra</i>, demanded vigorous
prosecution of the Lairds and others, and urged governmental
activity to prevent any further ship-building for the South<a name=
"FNanchor1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006">[1006]</a>.</p>
<p>On April 7, Russell wrote to Lyons:</p>
<blockquote>"The orders given to watch, and stop when evidence can
be procured, vessels apparently intended for the Confederate
service will, it is to be hoped, allay the strong feelings which
have been raised in Northern America by the escape from justice of
the <i>Oreto</i> and <i>Alabama</i><a name=
"FNanchor1007"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1007">[1007]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>It thus appears that orders had been issued to stop, on
<i>evidence</i> to be sure, but on evidence of the vessels being
"<i>apparently</i> intended" for the South. This was far from being
the same thing as the previous assertion that conclusive evidence
was required. What, then, was the basic consideration in Russell's
mind leading to such a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_137"></a>[V2:pg 137]</span> face-about on declared policy?
Chagrin at the very evident failure of existing neutrality law to
operate, recognition that there was just cause for the rising
ill-will of the North, no doubt influenced him, but more powerful
than these elements was the anxiety as to the real purpose and
intent in application of the American "privateering" Bill. How did
Russell, and Lyons, interpret that Bill and what complications did
they foresee and fear?</p>
<p>As previously stated in this chapter, the privateering Bill had
been introduced as an "administration measure" and for that reason
passed without serious debate. In the Cabinet it was opposed by
Welles, Secretary of the Navy, until he was overborne by the
feeling that "something must be done" because vessels were building
in England intended to destroy the blockade. The Rams under
construction were clearly understood to have that purpose. If
privateers were to offset the action of the Rams there must be some
definite plan for their use. Seward and Adams repeatedly complained
of British inaction yet in the same breath asserted that the
privateers were intended to chase and destroy <i>Alabamas</i>--a
plan so foolish, so it seemed to British diplomats, as to be
impossible of acceptance as the full purpose of Seward. How, in
short, <i>could</i> privateers make good an injury to blockade
about to be done by the Rams? If added to the blockading squadrons
on station off the Southern ports they would but become so much
more fodder for the dreaded Rams. If sent to sea in pursuit of
<i>Alabamas</i> the chances were that they would be the vanquished
rather than the victors in battle. There was no Southern mercantile
marine for them to attack and privateering against "enemy's
commerce" was thus out of the question since there was no such
commerce.</p>
<p>There remained but one reasonable supposition as to the intended
use of privateers. If the Rams compelled the relaxation of the
close blockade the only recourse of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_138"></a>[V2:pg 138]</span> North would be
to establish a "cruising squadron" blockade remote from the shores
of the enemy. If conducted by government war-ships such a blockade
was not in contravention to British interpretation of international
law<a name="FNanchor1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008">[1008]</a>.
But the Northern navy, conducting a cruising squadron blockade was
far too small to interfere seriously with neutral vessels bringing
supplies to the Confederacy or carrying cotton from Southern ports.
A "flood of privateers," scouring the ocean from pole to pole
might, conceivably, still render effective that closing in of the
South which was so important a weapon in the Northern war
programme.</p>
<p>This was Russell's interpretation of the American plan and he
saw in it a very great danger to British commerce and an inevitable
ultimate clash leading to war. Such, no doubt, it was Seward's
desire should be Russell's reaction, though never specifically
explaining the exact purpose of the privateers. Moreover,
nine-tenths of the actual blockade-running still going on was by
British ships, and this being so it was to be presumed that
"privateers" searching for possible blockade runners would commit
all sorts of indignities and interferences with British merchant
ships whether on a blockade-running trip or engaged in ordinary
trade between non-belligerent ports.</p>
<p>Immediately on learning from Lyons details of the privateering
bill, Russell had instructed the British Minister at Washington to
raise objections though not formally making official protest, and
had asked for explanation of the exact nature of the proposed
activities of such vessels. Also he had prepared instructions to be
issued by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_139"></a>[V2:pg
139]</span> Admiralty to British naval commanders as to their duty
of preventing unwarranted interference with legitimate British
commerce by privateers<a name="FNanchor1009"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1009">[1009]</a>. The alteration of governmental policy
as indicated in the arrest of the <i>Alexandra</i>, it might be
hoped, would at least cause a suspension of the American plan, but
assurances were strongly desired. Presumably Russell knew that
Adams as a result of their conversations, had recommended such
suspension, but at Washington, Lyons, as yet uninformed of the
<i>Alexandra</i> action, was still much alarmed. On April 13 he
reported that Seward had read to him a despatch to Adams, relative
to the ships building in England, indicating that this was "a last
effort to avert the evils which the present state of things had
made imminent<a name="FNanchor1010"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1010">[1010]</a>." Lyons had argued with Seward the
inadvisability of sending such a despatch, since it was now known
that Russell had "spoken in a satisfactory manner" about
Confederate vessels, but Seward was insistent. Lyons believed there
was real cause for anxiety, writing:</p>
<blockquote>"A good deal of allowance must be made for the evident
design of the Government and indeed of the people to intimidate
England, but still there can be little doubt that the exasperation
has reached such a point as to constitute a serious danger. It is
fully shared by many important members of the Cabinet--nor are the
men in high office exempt from the overweening idea of the naval
power of the United States, which reconciles the people to the
notion of a war with England. Mr. Seward for a certain time fanned
the flame in order to recover his lost popularity. He is now, I
believe, seriously anxious to avoid going farther. But if strong
measures against England were taken up as a Party cry by the
Republicans, Mr. Seward would oppose very feeble resistance to
them. If no military success be obtained within a short time, it
may become a Party necessity to resort to some means of producing
an excitement <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_140"></a>[V2:pg
140]</span> in the country sufficient to enable the Government to
enforce the Conscription Act, and to exercise the extra-legal
powers conferred by the late Congress, To produce such an
excitement the more ardent of the party would not hesitate to go,
to the verge of a war with England. Nay there are not a few who
already declare that if the South must be lost, the best mode to
conceal the discomfiture of the party and of the nation, would be
to go to war with England and attribute the loss of the South to
English interference<a name="FNanchor1011"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1011">[1011]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On the same day Lyons wrote, privately:</p>
<blockquote>"I would rather the quarrel came, if come it must, upon
some better ground for us than this question of the ships fitted
out for the Confederates. The great point to be gained in my
opinion, would be to prevent the ships sailing, without leading the
people here to think that they had gained their point by
threats<a name="FNanchor1012"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1012">[1012]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>So great was Lyons' alarm that the next day, April 14, he
cipher-telegraphed Monck in Canada that trouble was brewing<a name=
"FNanchor1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013">[1013]</a>, but soon
his fears were somewhat allayed. On the seventeenth he could report
that Seward's "strong" despatch to Adams was not intended for
communication to Russell<a name="FNanchor1014"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1014">[1014]</a>, and on the twenty-fourth when
presenting, under instructions, Russell's protest against the
privateering plan he was pleased, if not surprised, to find that
the "latest advices" from England and the news of the seizure of
the <i>Alexandra</i>, had caused Seward to become very
conciliatory. Lyons was assured that the plan "was for the present
at rest<a name="FNanchor1015"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1015">[1015]</a>." Apparently Seward now felt more
security than did Lyons as to future British action for three days
later the British Minister wrote to Vice-Admiral Milne that an
American issue of letters of marque would surely come if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_141"></a>[V2:pg 141]</span>
England did not stop Southern ship-building, and he wrote in such a
way as to indicate his own opinion that effective steps <i>must</i>
be taken to prevent their escape<a name="FNanchor1016"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1016">[1016]</a>.</p>
<p>The whole tone and matter of Lyons' despatches to Russell show
that he regarded the crisis of relations in regard to Southern
ship-building in British yards as occurring in March-April, 1863.
Seward became unusually friendly, even embarrassingly so, for in
August he virtually forced Lyons to go on tour with him through the
State of New York, thus making public demonstration of the good
relations of the two Governments. This sweet harmony and mutual
confidence is wholly contrary to the usual historical treatment of
the Laird Rams incident, which neglects the threat of the
privateering bill, regards American protests as steadily increasing
in vigour, and concludes with the "threat of war" note by Adams to
Russell just previous to the seizure of the Rams, in September.
Previously, however, American historians have been able to use only
American sources and have been at a loss to understand the
privateering plan, since Seward never went beyond a vague
generalization of its object in official utterances. It is the
British reaction to that plan which reveals the real "threat" made
and the actual crisis of the incident.</p>
<p>It follows therefore that the later story of the Rams requires
less extended treatment than is customarily given to it. The
correct understanding of this later story is the recognition that
Great Britain had in April given, a pledge and performed an act
which satisfied Seward and Adams that the Rams would not be
permitted to escape. It was their duty nevertheless to be on guard
against a British relaxation <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_142"></a>[V2:pg 142]</span> of the promise made, and the
delay, up to the very last moment, in seizing the Rams, caused
American anxiety and ultimately created a doubt of the sincerity of
British actions.</p>
<p>Public opinion in England was steadily increasing against
Southern ship-building. On June 9, a memorial was sent to the
Foreign Office by a group of ship-owners in Liverpool, suggesting
an alteration in the Foreign Enlistment Act if this were needed to
prevent the issue of Southern ships, and pointing out that the
"present policy" of the Government would entail a serious danger to
British commerce in the future if, when England herself became a
belligerent, neutral ports could be used by the enemy to build
commerce destroyers<a name="FNanchor1017"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1017">[1017]</a>. The memorial concluded that in any
case it was a disgrace that British law should be so publicly
infringed. To this, Hammond, under-secretary, gave the old answer
that the law was adequate "provided proof can be obtained of any
act done with the intent to violate it<a name=
"FNanchor1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018">[1018]</a>." Evidently
ship-owners, as distinguished from ship-builders, were now acutely
alarmed. Meanwhile attention was fixed on the trial of the
<i>Alexandra</i>, and on June 22, a decision was rendered against
the Government, but was promptly appealed.</p>
<p>This decision made both Northern and Southern agents anxious and
the latter took steps further to becloud the status of the Rams.
Rumours were spread that the vessels were in fact intended for
France, and when this was disproved that they were being built for
the Viceroy of Egypt. This also proved to be untrue. Finally it was
declared that the real owners were certain French merchants whose
purpose in contracting for such clearly warlike vessels was left in
mystery, but with the intimation that Egypt was to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_143"></a>[V2:pg 143]</span> the ultimate
purchaser. Captain Bullock had indeed made such a contract of sale
to French merchants but with the proviso of resale to him, after
delivery. On his part, Russell was seeking <i>proof</i> fully
adequate to seizure, but this was difficult to obtain and such as
was submitted was regarded by the law officers as inadequate. They
reported that there was "no evidence capable of being presented to
a court of justice." He informed Adams of this legal opinion at the
moment when the latter, knowing the Rams to be nearing completion,
and fearing that Russell was weakening in his earlier
determination, began that series of diplomatic protests which very
nearly approached a threat of war.</p>
<p>At Washington also anxiety was again aroused by the court's
decision in the <i>Alexandra</i> case, and shortly after the great
Northern victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, Seward wrote a
despatch to Adams, July 11, which has been interpreted as a
definite threat of war. In substance Seward wrote that he still
felt confident the Government of Great Britain would find a way to
nullify the <i>Alexandra</i> decision, but renewed, in case this
did not prove true, his assertion of Northern intention to issue
letters of marque, adding a phrase about the right to "pursue"
Southern vessels even into neutral ports<a name=
"FNanchor1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019">[1019]</a>. But there
are two considerations in respect to this despatch that largely
negative the belligerent intent attributed to it: Seward did not
read or communicate it to Lyons, as was his wont when anything
serious was in mind; and he did not instruct Adams to communicate
it to Russell. The latter never heard of it until the publication,
in 1864, of the United States diplomatic correspondence<a name=
"FNanchor1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020">[1020]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_144"></a>[V2:pg 144]</span>
<p>In London, on July 11, Adams began to present to Russell
evidence secured by Consul Dudley at Liverpool, relative to the
Rams and to urge their immediate seizure. Adams here but performed
his duty and was in fact acting in accordance with Russell's own
request<a name="FNanchor1021"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1021">[1021]</a>. On July 16 he reported to Seward that
the Roebuck motion for recognition of the South<a name=
"FNanchor1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022">[1022]</a> had died
ingloriously, but expressed a renewal of anxiety because of the
slowness of the government; if the Rams were to escape, Adams wrote
to Russell, on July 11, Britain would herself become a participant
in the war<a name="FNanchor1023"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1023">[1023]</a>. Further affidavits were sent to
Russell on August 14, and on September 3, having heard from Russell
that the Government was legally advised "they cannot interfere in
any way with these vessels," Adams sent still more affidavits and
expressed his regret that his previous notes had not sufficiently
emphasized the grave nature of the crisis pending between the
United States and Great Britain. To this Russell replied that the
matter was "under serious and anxious consideration," to which, on
September 5, in a long communication, Adams wrote that if the Rams
escaped: "It would be superfluous in me to point out to your
Lordship that this is war."</p>
<p>The phrase was carefully chosen to permit a denial of a threat
of war on the explanation that Great Britain would herself be
participating in the war. There is no question that at the moment
Adams thought Russell's "change of policy" of April was now thrown
overboard, but the fact was that on September 1, Russell had
already <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_145"></a>[V2:pg
145]</span> given directions to take steps for the detention of the
Rams and that on September 3, positive instructions were given to
that effect<a name="FNanchor1024"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1024">[1024]</a>, though not carried out until some days
later. There had been no alteration in the "new policy" of April;
the whole point of the delay was governmental anxiety to secure
evidence sufficient to convict and thus to avoid attack for acting
in contradiction to those principles which had been declared to be
the compelling principles of non-interference in the case of the
<i>Alabama</i>. But so perfect were the arrangements of Captain
Bullock that complete evidence was not procurable and Russell was
forced, finally, to act without it<a name=
"FNanchor1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025">[1025]</a>.</p>
<p>It would appear from a letter written by Russell to Palmerston,
on September 3, the day on which he gave the order to stop, that no
Cabinet approval for this step had yet formally been given, since
Russell notified Palmerston of his purpose and asked the latter, if
he disapproved, to call a Cabinet at once<a name=
"FNanchor1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026">[1026]</a>. The
<i>plan</i> to stop the Rams must have long been understood for
Palmerston called no Cabinet. Moreover it is to be presumed that he
was preparing the public for the seizure, for on this same
September 3, the <i>Times</i>, in a long editorial, argued that the
law as it stood (or was interpreted), was not in harmony with true
neutrality, and pointed out future dangers to British commerce, as
had the Liverpool ship-owners. Delane of the <i>Times</i> was at
this period especially close to Palmerston, and it is at least
inferential that the editorial was an advance notice of
governmental intention to apply a policy known in intimate circles
to have been for some time matured. Four days <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_146"></a>[V2:pg 146]</span> later, while
governmental action was still unknown to the public another
editorial advocated seizure of the Rams<a name=
"FNanchor1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027">[1027]</a>. Russell had
acted under the fear that one of the Rams might slip away as had
the <i>Alabama</i>; he had sent orders to stop and investigate, but
he delayed final seizure in the hope that better evidence might yet
be secured, conducting a rapid exchange of letters with Lairds (the
builders), seeking to get admissions from them. It was only on
September 9 that Lairds was officially ordered not to send the
vessels on a "trial trip," and it was not until September 16 that
public announcement was made of the Government's action<a name=
"FNanchor1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028">[1028]</a>.</p>
<p>Russell has been regarded as careless and thoughtless in that it
was not until September 8 he relieved Adams' mind by assuring him
the Rams would be seized, even though three days before, on
September 5, this information had been sent to Washington. The
explanation is Russell's eager search for evidence to
<i>convict</i>, and his correspondence with Lairds which did not
come to a head until the eighth, when the builders refused to give
information. To the builders Russell was writing as if a
governmental decision had not yet been reached. He could take no
chance of a "leak" through the American Minister. Once informed,
Adams was well satisfied though his immediate reaction was to
criticize, not Russell, but the general "timidity and vacillation"
of the law officers of the Crown<a name="FNanchor1029"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1029">[1029]</a>. Two days later, having learned from
Russell himself just what was taking place, Adams described the
"firm stand" taken by the Foreign Secretary, noted the general
approval by the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_147"></a>[V2:pg 147]</span> public press and expressed the
opinion that there was now a better prospect of being able to
preserve friendly relations with England than at any time since his
arrival in London<a name="FNanchor1030"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1030">[1030]</a>. Across the water British officials
were delighted with the seizure of the Rams. Monck in Canada
expressed his approval<a name="FNanchor1031"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1031">[1031]</a>. Lyons reported a "great improvement"
in the feeling toward England and that Seward especially was highly
pleased with Russell's expressions, conveyed privately, of esteem
for Seward together with the hope that he would remain in
office<a name="FNanchor1032"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1032">[1032]</a>.</p>
<p>The actual governmental seizure of the Rams did not occur until
mid-October, though they had been placed under official
surveillance on September 9. Both sides were jockeying for position
in the expected legal battle when the case should be taken up by
the courts<a name="FNanchor1033"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1033">[1033]</a>. At first Russell even thought of
making official protest to Mason in London and a draft of such
protest was prepared, approved by the Law Officers and subsequently
revised by Palmerston, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_148"></a>[V2:pg 148]</span> but finally was not sent<a name=
"FNanchor1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034">[1034]</a>. Possibly it
was thought that such a communication to Mason approached too
nearly a recognition of him in his desired official capacity, for
in December the protest ultimately directed to be made through
Consul-General Crawford at Havana, instructed him to go to Richmond
and after stating very plainly that he was in no way recognizing
the Confederacy to present the following:</p>
<blockquote>"It appears from various correspondence the
authenticity of which cannot be doubted, that the Confederate
Government having no good ports free from the blockade of the
Federals have conceived the design of using the ports of the United
Kingdom for the purpose of constructing ships of war to be equipped
and armed to serve as cruisers against the commerce of the United
States of America, a State with which Her Majesty is at
peace...."<br>
<br>
"These acts are inconsistent with the respect and comity which
ought to be shewn by a belligerent towards a Neutral Power.<br>
<br>
"Her Majesty has declared her Neutrality and means strictly to
observe it.<br>
<br>
"You will therefore call upon Mr. Benjamin to induce his Government
to forbear from all acts tending to affect injuriously Her
Majesty's position<a name="FNanchor1035"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1035">[1035]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>To carry out this instruction there was required permission for
Crawford to pass through the blockade but Seward refused this when
Lyons made the request<a name="FNanchor1036"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1036">[1036]</a>.</p>
<p>Not everyone in Britain, however, approved the Government's
course in seizing the Rams. Legal opinion especially was very
generally against the act. Adams now pressed either for an
alteration of the British law or for a convention <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_149"></a>[V2:pg 149]</span> with America
establishing mutual similar interpretation of neutral duty. Russell
replied that "until the trials of the <i>Alexandra</i> and the
steam rams had taken place, we could hardly be said to know what
our law was, and therefore not tell whether it required alteration.
I said, however, that he might assure Mr. Seward that the wish and
intention of Government were to make our neutrality an honest and
bona-fide one<a name="FNanchor1037"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1037">[1037]</a>." But save from extreme and avowed
Southern sympathizers criticism of the Government was directed less
to the stoppage of the Rams than to attacks of a political
character, attempting to depict the weakness of the Foreign
Minister and his humiliation of Great Britain in having "yielded to
American threats." Thus, February II, 1864, after the reassembling
of Parliament, a party attack was made on Russell and the
Government by Derby in the House of Lords. Derby approved the
stopping of the Rams but sought to prove that the Government had
dishonoured England by failing to act of its own volition until
threatened by America. He cited Seward's despatch of July II with
much unction, that despatch now having appeared in the printed
American diplomatic correspondence with no indication that it was
not an instruction at once communicated to Russell. The attack fell
flat for Russell simply replied that Adams had never presented such
an instruction. This forced Derby to seek other ground and on
February 15 he returned to the matter, now seeking to show by the
dates of various documents that "at the last moment" Adams made a
threat of war and Russell had yielded. Again Russell's reply was
brief and to the effect that orders to stop the Rams had been given
before the communications from Adams were received. Finally, on
February 23, a motion in the Commons called for all correspondence
with Adams and with Lairds, The <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_150"></a>[V2:pg 150]</span> Government consented to the
first but refused that with Lairds and was supported by a vote of
187 to 153<a name="FNanchor1038"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1038">[1038]</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning with an incautious personal and petty criticism of
Russell the Tories had been driven to an attempt to pass what was
virtually a vote of censure on the Ministry yet they were as loud
as was the Government in praise of Adams and in approval of the
seizure of the Rams. Naturally their cause was weakened, and the
Ministry, referring to expressions made and intentions indicated as
far back as March, 1863, thus hinting without directly so stating
that the real decision had then been made, was easily the victor in
the vote<a href="#Footnote_1038">[1038]</a>. Derby had committed an
error as a party leader and the fault rankled for again in April,
1864, he attempted to draw Russell into still further discussion on
dates of documents. Russell's reply ignored that point
altogether<a name="FNanchor1039"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1039">[1039]</a>. It did not suit his purpose to
declare, flatly, the fact that in April assurances had been given
both to Adams and through Lyons to Seward, that measures would be
taken to prevent the departure of Southern vessels from British
ports. To have made this disclosure would have required an
explanation <i>why</i> such assurance had been given and this would
have revealed the effect on both Russell and Lyons of the Northern
plan to create a <i>cruising squadron blockade by privateers</i>.
<i>There</i> was the real threat. The later delays and seeming
uncertainties of British action made Adams anxious but there is no
evidence that Russell ever changed his purpose. He sought stronger
evidence before acting and he hoped for stronger support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_151"></a>[V2:pg 151]</span>
from legal advisers, but he kept an eye on the Rams and when they
had reached the stage where there was danger of escape, he seized
them even though the desired evidence was still lacking<a name=
"FNanchor1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040">[1040]</a>. Seward's
"privateering bill" plan possibly entered upon in a moment of
desperation and with no clear statement from him of its exact
application had, as the anxiety of British diplomats became
pronounced, been used with skill to permit, if not to state, the
interpretation they placed upon it, and the result had been the
cessation of that inadequate neutrality of which America
complained.</p>

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_966"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor966">[966]</a> In other respects, also, this question of
belligerent ship-building and equipping in neutral ports was, in
practice, vaguely defined. As late as 1843 in the then existing
Texan war of independence against Mexico, the British Foreign
Secretary, Aberdeen, had been all at sea. Mexico made a contract
for two ships of war with the English firm of Lizardi &amp;
Company. The crews were to be recruited in England, the ships were
to be commanded by British naval officers on leave, and the guns
were to be purchased from firms customarily supplying the British
Navy. Aberdeen advised the Admiralty to give the necessary
authority to purchase guns. When Texas protested he at first seemed
to think strict neutrality was secured if the same privileges were
offered that country. Later he prohibited naval officers to go in
command. One Mexican vessel, the <i>Guadaloupe</i>, left England
with full equipment as originally planned; the other, the
<i>Montezuma</i>, was forced to strip her equipment. But both
vessels sailed under British naval officers for these were
permitted to resign their commissions. They were later reinstated.
In all this there was in part a temporary British policy to aid
Mexico, but it is also clear that British governmental opinion was
much in confusion as to neutral duty in the case of such ships. See
my book, <i>British Interests and Activities in Texas</i>, Ch.
IV.</blockquote>

above are given by F.A. Golder, <i>The Russian Fleet and the Civil
War</i> (<i>Am. Hist. Rev</i>., July, 1915, pp. 801 <i>seq</i>.).
The plan was to have the fleet attack enemy commerce. The idea of
aid to the North was "born on American soil," and Russian officers
naturally did nothing to contradict its spread. In one case,
however, a Russian commander was ready to help the North.
Rear-Admiral Papov with six vessels in the harbour of San Francisco

<blockquote><a name="Footnote_993"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor993">[993]</a> American opinion knew little of this
change. An interesting, if somewhat irrational and irregular plan
to thwart Southern ship-building operations, had been taken up by
the United States Navy Department. This was to buy the Rams
outright by the offer of such a price as, it was thought, would be
so tempting to the Lairds as to make refusal unlikely. Two men,
Forbes and Aspinwall, were sent to England with funds and much
embarrassed Adams to whom they discreetly refrained from stating
details, but yet permitted him to guess their object. The plan of
buying ran wholly counter to Adams' diplomatic protests on
England's duty in international law and the agents themselves soon
saw the folly of it. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, wrote to
Dupont, March 26, 1863: "The Confederate ironclads in England, I
think, will be taken care of." (Correspondence, I, 196.) Thurlow
Weed wrote to Bigelow, April 16, of the purpose of the visit of
Forbes and Aspinwall. (Bigelow, <i>Retrospections</i>, I, 632.)
Forbes reported as early as April 18 virtually against going on
with the plan. "We must keep cool here, and prepare the way; we
have put new fire into Mr. Dudley by furnishing <i>fuel</i>, and he
is hard at it getting evidence.... My opinion <i>to-day</i> is that
we can and shall stop by legal process and by the British
Government the sailing of ironclads and other war-ships." (Forbes
MS. To Fox.) That this was wholly a Navy Department plan and was
disliked by State Department representatives is shown by Dudley's
complaints (Forbes MS.). The whole incident has been adequately
discussed by C.F. Adams, though without reference to the preceding
citations, in his <i>Studies Military and Diplomatic</i>, Ch. IX.
"An Historical Residuum," in effect a refutation of an article by
Chittenden written in 1890, in which bad memory and
misunderstanding played sad havoc with historical
truth.</blockquote>

September 5. This last was the result of Adams' misgivings reported
in mid-August, and it is not until these were received (in my
interpretation) that Seward really began to fear the "pledge" made
in April would not be carried out. Adams himself, in 1864, read to
Russell a communication from Seward denying that his July 11

Russell and his diary records were early the main basis of
historical treatment. Rhodes, IV, 381-84, has disproved the
accusation of Russell's yielding to a threat. Brooks Adams (Mass.

ignores Rhodes, harks back to the old argument and amplifies it

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>ROEBUCK'S MOTION</h3>
<br>
<p>In the mid-period during which the British Government was
seeking to fulfil its promise of an altered policy as regards
ship-building and while the public was unaware that such a promise
had been given, certain extreme friends of the South thought the
time had come for renewed pressure upon the Government, looking
toward recognition of the Confederacy. The <i>Alexandra</i> had
been seized in April, but the first trial, though appealed, had
gone against the Government in June, and there was no knowledge
that the Ministry was determined in its stand. From January to the
end of March, 1863, the public demonstrations in approval of the
emancipation proclamation had somewhat checked expressions of
Southern sympathy, but by the month of June old friends had
recovered their courage and a new champion of the South came
forward in the person of Roebuck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the activities of Southern agents and Southern friends
had not ceased even if they had, for a time, adopted a less
vigorous tone. For four months after the British refusal of
Napoleon's overtures on mediation, in November, 1862, the friends
of the South were against "acting now," but this did not imply that
they thought the cause lost or in any sense hopeless. Publicists
either neutral in attitude or even professedly sympathetic with the
North could see no outcome of the Civil War save separation of
North and South. Thus the historian Freeman in the preface to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_153"></a>[V2:pg 153]</span>
first volume of his uncompleted <i>History of Federal
Government</i>, published in 1863, carefully explained that his
book did not have its origin in the struggle in America, and argued
that the breaking up of the Union in no way proved any inherent
weakness in a federal system, but took it for granted that American
reunion was impossible. The novelist, Anthony Trollope, after a
long tour of the North, beginning in September, 1861, published
late in 1862 a two-volume work, <i>North America</i>, descriptive
of a nation engaged in the business of war and wholly sympathetic
with the Northern cause. Yet he, also, could see no hope of forcing
the South back into the Union. "The North and South are virtually
separated, and the day will come in which the West also will
secede<a name="FNanchor1041"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1041">[1041]</a>."</p>
<p>Such interpretations of conditions in America were not unusual;
they were, rather, generally accepted. The Cabinet decision in
November, 1862, was not regarded as final, though events were to
prove it to be so for never again was there so near an approach to
British intervention. Mason's friend, Spence, early began to think
that true Southern policy was now to make an appeal to the Tories
against the Government. In January, 1863, he was planning a new
move:</p>
<blockquote>"I have written to urge Mr. Gregory to be here in time
for a thorough organization so as to push the matter this time to a
vote. I think the Conservatives may be got to move as a body and if
so the result of a vote seems to me very certain. I have seen Mr.
Horsfall and Mr. Laird here and will put myself in communication
with Mr. Disraeli as the time approaches for action for this seems
to me now our best card<a name="FNanchor1042"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1042">[1042]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>That some such effort was being thought of is evidenced by the
attitude of the <i>Index</i> which all through the months from
November, 1862, to the middle of January, 1863, had <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_154"></a>[V2:pg 154]</span> continued to
harp on the subject of mediation as if still believing that
something yet might be done by the existing Ministry, but which
then apparently gave up hope of the Palmerstonian
administration:</p>
<blockquote>"But what the Government means is evident enough. It
does not mean to intervene or to interfere. It will not mediate, if
it can help it; it will not recognize the Confederate States,
unless there should occur some of those 'circumstances over which
they have no control,' which leave weak men and weak ministers no
choice. They will not, if they are not forced to it, quarrel with
Mr. Seward, or with Mr. Bright. They will let Lancashire starve;
they will let British merchantmen be plundered off Nassau and burnt
off Cuba; they will submit to a blockade of Bermuda or of
Liverpool; but they will do nothing which may tend to bring a
supply of cotton from the South, or to cut off the supply of eggs
and bacon from the North<a name="FNanchor1043"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1043">[1043]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But this plan of 'turning to the Tories' received scant
encouragement and was of no immediate promise, as soon appeared by
the debate in Parliament on reassembling, February 5, 1863. Derby
gave explicit approval of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_155"></a>[V2:pg 155]</span> Government's refusal to listen
to Napoleon<a name="FNanchor1044"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1044">[1044]</a>. By February, Russell, having recovered
from the smart of defeat within the Cabinet, declared himself weary
of the perpetual talk about mediation and wrote to Lyons, "... till
both parties are heartily tired and sick of the business, I see no
use in talking of good offices. When that time comes Mercier will
probably have a hint; let him have all the honour and glory of
being the first<a name="FNanchor1045"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1045">[1045]</a>." For the time being Spence's idea was
laid aside, Gregory writing in response to an inquiry from
Mason:</p>
<blockquote>"The House of Commons is opposed to taking any step at
present, feeling rightly or wrongly that to do so would be useless
to the South, and possibly embroil us with the North. Any motion on
the subject will be received with disfavour, consequently the way
in which it will be treated will only make the North more elated,
and will irritate the South against us. If I saw the slightest
chance of a motion being received with any favour I would not let
it go into other hands, but I find the most influential men of all
Parties opposed to it<a name="FNanchor1046"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1046">[1046]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Of like opinion was Slidell who, writing of the situation in
France, reported that he had been informed by his "friend at the
Foreign Office" that "It is believed that every possible thing has
been done here in your behalf--we must now await the action of
England, and it is through that you must aim all your efforts in
that direction<a name="FNanchor1047"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1047">[1047]</a>."</p>
<p>With the failure, at least temporary, of Southern efforts to
move the British Government or to stir Parliament, energies were
now directed toward using financial methods of winning support for
the Southern cause. The "Confederate Cotton Loan" was undertaken
with the double <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_156"></a>[V2:pg 156]</span> object of providing funds for
Southern agents in Europe and of creating an interested support of
the South, which might, it was hoped, ultimately influence the
British Government.</p>
<p>By 1863 it had become exceedingly difficult, owing to the
blockade, for the Government at Richmond to transmit funds to its
agents abroad. Bullock, especially, required large amounts in
furtherance of his ship-building contracts and was embarrassed by
the lack of business methods and the delays of the Government at
home. The incompetence of the Confederacy in finance was a weakness
that characterized all of its many operations whether at home or
abroad<a name="FNanchor1048"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1048">[1048]</a> and was made evident in England by the
confusion in its efforts to establish credits there. At first the
Confederate Government supplied its agents abroad with drafts upon
the house of Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Company, of Liverpool, a branch
of the firm long established at Charleston, South Carolina,
purchasing its bills of exchange with its own "home made" money.
But as Confederate currency rapidly depreciated this method of
transmitting funds became increasingly difficult and costly. The
next step was to send to Spence, nominated by Mason as financial
adviser in England, Confederate money bonds for sale on the British
market, with authority to dispose of them as low as fifty cents on
the dollar, but these found no takers<a name=
"FNanchor1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049">[1049]</a>. By
September, 1862, Bullock's funds for ship-building were exhausted
and some new method of supply was required. Temporary relief was
found in adopting a suggestion from Lindsay whereby cotton was made
the basis for an advance of &pound;60,000, a form of cotton bond
being devised which fixed the price of cotton at eightpence the
pound. These bonds were not put on the market but were privately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_157"></a>[V2:pg 157]</span>
placed by Lindsay &amp; Company with a few buyers for the entire
sum, the transaction remaining secret<a name=
"FNanchor1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050">[1050]</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime this same recourse to cotton had occurred to the
authorities at Richmond and a plan formulated by which cotton
should be purchased by the Government, stored, and certificates
issued to be sold abroad, the purchaser being assured of "all
facilities of shipment." Spence was to be the authorized agent for
the sale of these "cotton certificates," but before any reached him
various special agents of the Confederacy had arrived in England by
December, 1862, with such certificates in their possession and had
disposed of some of them, calling them "cotton warrants." The
difficulties which might arise from separate action in the market
were at once perceived and following a conference with Mason all
cotton obligations were turned to Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Company.
Spence now had in his hands the "money bonds" but no further
attempt was made to dispose of these since the "cotton warrants"
were considered a better means of raising funds.</p>
<p>It is no doubt true that since all of these efforts involved a
governmental guarantee the various "certificates" or "warrants"
partook of the nature of a government bond. Yet up to this point
the Richmond authorities, after the first failure to sell "money
bonds" abroad were not keen to attempt anything that could be
stamped as a foreign "government loan." Their idea was rather that
a certain part of the produce of the South was being set aside as
the property of those who in England should extend credit to the
South. The sole purpose of these earlier operations was to provide
funds for Southern agents. By July, 1862, Bullock had exhausted his
earlier credit of a million dollars. The &pound;60,000 loan secured
through Lindsay then tided over an emergency demand and this had
been followed by a development on similar lines of the "cotton
certificates" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_158"></a>[V2:pg
158]</span> and "warrants" which by December, 1862, had secured,
through Spence's agency, an additional million dollars or
thereabouts. Mason was strongly recommending further expansion of
this method and had the utmost confidence in Spence. Now, however,
there was broached to the authorities in Richmond a proposal for
the definite floating in Europe of a specified "cotton loan."</p>
<p>This proposal came through Slidell at Paris and was made by the
well-established firm of Erlanger &amp; Company. First approached
by this company in September, 1862, Slidell consulted Mason but
found the latter strongly committed to his own plans with
Spence<a name="FNanchor1051"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1051">[1051]</a>. But Slidell persisted and Mason gave
way<a name="FNanchor1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052">[1052]</a>.
Representatives of Erlanger proceeded to Richmond and proposed a
loan of twenty-five million dollars; they were surprised to find
the Confederate Government disinclined to the idea of a foreign
loan, and the final agreement, cut to fifteen millions, was largely
made because of the argument advanced that as a result powerful
influences would thus be brought to the support of the
South<a name="FNanchor1053"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1053">[1053]</a>. The contract was signed at Richmond,
January 28, 1863, and legalized by a secret act of Congress on the
day following<a name="FNanchor1054"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1054">[1054]</a>. But there was no Southern enthusiasm
for the project. Benjamin wrote to Mason that the Confederacy
disclaimed the "desire or intention on our part to effect a loan in
Europe ... during the war we want only such very moderate sums as
are required abroad for the purchase of warlike supplies and for
vessels, and even that is not required because of our want of
funds, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_159"></a>[V2:pg
159]</span> but because of the difficulties of remittance"; as for
the Erlanger contract the Confederacy "would have declined it
altogether but for the political considerations indicated by Mr.
Slidell<a name="FNanchor1055"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1055">[1055]</a>...."</p>
<p>From Mason's view-point the prime need was to secure money; from
Slidell's (at least so asserted) it was to place a loan with the
purpose of establishing strong friends. It had been agreed to
suspend the operations of Spence until the result of Erlanger's
offer was learned, but pressure brought by Caleb Huse, purchasing
agent of the Confederacy, caused a further sale of "cotton
warrants<a name="FNanchor1056"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1056">[1056]</a>." Spence, fearing he was about to be
shelved, became vexed and made protest to Mason, while Slidell
regarded Spence<a name="FNanchor1057"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1057">[1057]</a> as a weak and meddlesome agent<a name=
"FNanchor1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058">[1058]</a>. But on
February 14, 1863, Erlanger's agents returned to Paris and
uncertainty was at an end. Spence went to Paris, saw Erlanger, and
agreed to co-operate in floating the loan<a name=
"FNanchor1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059">[1059]</a>. Then
followed a remarkable bond market operation, interesting, not so
much as regards the financial returns to the South, for these were
negligible, as in relation to the declared object of Slidell and
the Richmond Government--namely, the "strong influences" that would
accompany the successful flotation of a loan.</p>
<p>Delay in beginning operations was caused by the failure to
receive promptly the authenticated copy of the Act of Congress
authorizing the loan, which did not arrive until March 18. By this
contract Erlanger &amp; Company, sole managers of the loan, had
guaranteed flotation of the entire $15,000,000 at not less than 77,
the profit of the Company to be five per cent., plus the difference
between 77 and the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_160"></a>[V2:pg 160]</span> actual price received, but the
first $300,000 taken was to be placed at once at the disposal of
the Government. The bonds were put on the market March 19, in
London, Liverpool, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, but practically
all operations were confined to England. The bid for the loan was
entitled "<i>Seven per Cent. Cotton Loan of the Confederate States
of America for</i> 3 <i>Millions Sterling at</i> 90 <i>per
Cent</i>." The bonds were to bear interest at seven per cent. and
were to be exchangeable for cotton at the option of the holder at
the price of sixpence "for each pound of cotton, at any time not
later than six months after the ratification of a treaty of peace
between the present belligerents." There were provisions for the
gradual redemption of the bonds in gold for those who did not
desire cotton. Subscribers were to pay 5 per cent. on application.
10 per cent. on allotment, 10 per cent. on each of the days, the
first of May, June and July, 1863, and 15 per cent. on the first of
August, September and October.</p>
<p>Since the price of cotton in England was then 21 pence per pound
it was thought here was a sufficiently wide margin to offer at
least a good chance of enormous profits to the buyer of the bonds.
True "the loan was looked upon as a wild cotton speculation<a name=
"FNanchor1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060">[1060]</a>," but odds
were so large as to induce a heavy gamblers' plunge, for it seemed
hardly conceivable that cotton could for some years go below
sevenpence per pound, and even that figure would have meant profit,
<i>if</i> the Confederacy were established. Moreover, even though
the loan was not given official recognition by the London stock
exchange, the financial columns of the <i>Times</i> and the
<i>Economist</i> favoured it and the subscriptions were so prompt
and so heavy that in two days the loan was reported as
over-subscribed three times in London alone<a name=
"FNanchor1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061">[1061]</a>. With the
closing of the subscription the bonds went up to 95-1/2.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_161"></a>[V2:pg 161]</span>
Slidell wrote: "It is a financial recognition of our independence,
emanating from a class proverbially cautious, and little given to
be influenced by sentiment or sympathy<a name=
"FNanchor1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062">[1062]</a>." On Friday,
March 27, the allotment took place and three days later Mason
wrote, "I think I may congratulate you, therefore, on the
triumphant success of our infant credit--it shows,
<i>malgr&eacute;</i> all detraction and calumny, that cotton is
king at last<a name="FNanchor1063"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1063">[1063]</a>."</p>
<p>"Alas for the King! Two days later his throne began to tremble
and it took all the King's horses and all the King's men to keep
him in state<a name="FNanchor1064"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1064">[1064]</a>." On April 1, the flurry of speculation
had begun to falter and the loan was below par; on the second it
dropped to 3-1/2 discount, and by the third the promoters and the
Southern diplomats were very anxious. They agreed that someone must
be "bearing" the bonds and suspected Adams of supplying Northern
funds for that purpose<a name="FNanchor1065"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1065">[1065]</a>. Spence wrote from Liverpool in great
alarm and coincidently Erlanger &amp; Company urged that Mason
should authorize the use of the receipts already secured to hold up
the price of the bonds. Mason was very reluctant to do this<a name=
"FNanchor1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066">[1066]</a>, but finally
yielded when informed of the result of an interview between Spence,
Erlanger, and the latter's chief London agent, Schroeder. Spence
had proposed a withdrawal of a part of the loan from the market as
likely to have a stabilizing effect, and opposed the Erlanger plan
of using the funds already in hand. But <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_162"></a>[V2:pg 162]</span> Schroeder
coolly informed him that if the Confederate representative refused
to authorize the use of these funds to sustain the market, then
Erlanger would regard his Company as having "completed their
contract ... which was simply to issue the Loan." "Having issued
it, they did not and do not guarantee that the public would pay up
their instalments. If the public abandon the loan, the 15 per cent
sacrificed is, in point of fact, not the property of the Government
at all, but the profits of Messrs. Erlanger &amp; Co., actually in
their hands, and they cannot be expected to take a worse position.
At any rate they will not do so, and unless the compact can be made
on the basis we name, matters must take their course<a name=
"FNanchor1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067">[1067]</a>."</p>
<p>In the face of this ultimatum, Spence advised yielding as he
"could not hesitate ... seeing that nothing could be so disastrous
politically, as well as financially, as the public break-down of
the Loan<a name="FNanchor1068"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1068">[1068]</a>." Mason gave the required authorization
and this was later approved from Richmond. For a time the "bulling"
of the loan was successful, but again and again required the use of
funds received from actual sales of bonds and in the end the loan
netted very little to the Confederacy. Some $6,000,000 was
squandered in supporting the market and from the entire operation
it is estimated that less than $7,000,000 was realized by the
Confederacy, although, as stated by the <i>Economist</i>, over
$12,000,000 of the bonds were outstanding and largely in the hands
of British investors at the end of the war<a name=
"FNanchor1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069">[1069]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_163"></a>[V2:pg 163]</span>
<p>The loan soon became, not as had been hoped and prophesied by
Slidell, a source of valuable public support, but rather a mere
barometer of Southern fortunes<a name="FNanchor1070"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1070">[1070]</a>. From first to last the Confederate
Cotton Loan bore to subscribers the aspect of a speculative venture
and lacked the regard attached to sound investment. This fact in
itself denied to the loan any such favourable influence, or
"financial recognition of the Confederacy," as Mason and Slidell,
in the first flush of success, attributed to it. The rapid
fluctuations in price further discredited it and tended to
emphasize the uncertainty of Southern victory. Thus "confidence in
the South" was, if anything, lessened instead of increased by this
turning from political to financial methods of bringing pressure
upon the Government<a name="FNanchor1071"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1071">[1071]</a>.</p>
<p>Southern political and parliamentary pressure had indeed been
reserved from January to June, 1863. Public attention was
distracted from the war in America by the Polish question, which
for a time, particularly during the months of March and April,
1863, disturbed the good relations existing between England and
France since the Emperor seemed bent on going beyond British
"meddling," even to pursuing a policy that easily might lead to war
with Russia. Europe diverted interest from America, and Napoleon
himself was for the moment more concerned over the Polish question
than with American affairs, even though the Mexican venture was
still a worry to him. It was no time for a British parliamentary
"push" and when a question was raised on the cotton famine in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_164"></a>[V2:pg 164]</span>
Lancashire little attention was given it, though ordinarily it
would have been seized upon as an opportunity for a pro-Southern
demonstration. This was a bitter attack by one Ferrand in the
Commons, on April 27, directed against the cotton manufacturers as
lukewarm over employees' sufferings. Potter, a leading cotton
manufacturer, replied to the attack. Potter and his brother were
already prominent as strong partisans of the North, yet no effort
was made to use the debate to the advantage of the South<a name=
"FNanchor1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072">[1072]</a>.</p>
<p>In late May both necessity and fortuitous circumstance seemed to
make advisable another Southern effort in Parliament. The cotton
loan, though fairly strong again because of Confederate
governmental aid, was in fact a failure in its expected result of
public support for the South; something must be done to offset that
failure. In Polish affairs France had drawn back; presumably
Napoleon was again eager for some active effort. Best of all, the
military situation in America was thought to indicate Southern
success; Grant's western campaign had come to a halt with the
stubborn resistance of the great Mississippi stronghold at
Vicksburg, while in Virginia, Lee, on May 2-3, had overwhelmingly
defeated Hooker at Chancellorsville and was preparing, at last, a
definite offensive campaign into Northern territory. Lee's advance
north did not begin until June 10, but his plan was early known in
a select circle in England and much was expected of it. The time
seemed ripe, therefore, and the result was notification by Roebuck
of a motion for the recognition of the Confederacy--first step the
real purpose of which was to attempt that 'turning to the Tories'
which had been advocated by Spence in January, but postponed on the
advice of Gregory<a name="FNanchor1073"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1073">[1073]</a>. <i>The Index</i> clearly indicated
where lay the wind: "No one," it declared "now asks what will be
the policy of Great <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_165"></a>[V2:pg 165]</span> Britain towards America; but
everybody anxiously waits on what the Emperor of the French will
do."</p>
<blockquote>"... England to-day pays one of the inevitable
penalties of free government and of material prosperity, that of
having at times at the head of national affairs statesmen who
belong rather to the past than to the present, and whose skill and
merit are rather the business tact and knowledge of details,
acquired by long experience, than the quick and prescient
comprehension of the requirements of sudden emergencies....<br>
<br>
"The nominal conduct of Foreign Affairs is in the hands of a
diplomatic Malaprop, who has never shown vigour, activity, or
determination, except where the display of these qualities was
singularly unneeded, or even worse than useless.... From Great
Britain, then, under her actual Government, the Cabinet at
Washington has nothing to fear, and the Confederate States nothing
to expect<a name="FNanchor1074"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1074">[1074]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Of main interest to the public was the military situation. The
<i>Times</i> minimized the western campaigns, regarding them as
required for political effect to hold the north-western states
loyal to the Union, and while indulging in no prophecies as to the
fate of Vicksburg, expressing the opinion that, if forced to
surrender it, the South could easily establish "a new Vicksburg" at
some other point<a name="FNanchor1075"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1075">[1075]</a>. Naturally <i>The Index</i> was pleased
with and supported this view<a name="FNanchor1076"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1076">[1076]</a>. Such ignorance of the geographic
importance of Vicksburg may seem like wilful misleading of the
public; but professed British military experts were equally
ignorant. Captain Chesney, Professor of Military History at
Sandhurst College, published in 1863, an analysis of American
campaigns, centering all attention on the battles in Maryland and
Virginia and reaching the conclusion that the South could resist,
indefinitely, any Northern attack<a name=
"FNanchor1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077">[1077]</a>. He
dismissed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_166"></a>[V2:pg
166]</span> the western campaigns as of no real significance. W.H.
Russell, now editor of the <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i>, better
understood Grant's objectives on the Mississippi but believed
Northern reconquest of the South to the point of restoration of the
Union to be impossible. If, however, newspaper comments on the
success of Southern armies were to be regarded as favourable to
Roebuck's motion for recognition, W.H. Russell was against it.</p>
<blockquote>"If we could perceive the smallest prospect of awaking
the North to the truth, or of saving the South from the loss and
trials of the contest by recognition, we would vote for it
to-morrow. But next to the delusion of the North that it can
breathe the breath of life into the corpse of the murdered Union
again, is the delusion of some people in England who imagine that
by recognition we would give life to the South, divide the nations
on each side of the black and white line for ever, and bring this
war to the end. There is probably not one of these clamourers for
recognition who could define the limits of the State to be
recognized.... And, over and above all, recognition, unless it
meant 'war,' would be an aggravation of the horrors of the contest;
it would not aid the South one whit, and it would add immensely to
the unity and the fury of the North<a name=
"FNanchor1078"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1078">[1078]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary was at first little concerned at
Roebuck's motion, writing to Lyons, "You will see that Roebuck has
given notice of a motion to recognize the South. But I think it
certain that neither Lord Derby nor Cobden will support it, and I
should think no great number of the Liberal party. Offshoots from
all parties will compose the minority<a name=
"FNanchor1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079">[1079]</a>." Russell
was correct in this view but not so did it appear to Southern
agents who now became active at the request of Roebuck and Lindsay
in securing from the Emperor renewed expressions of willingness to
act, and promptly, if England would but give the word. There was no
real hope that Russell would change his policy, but <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_167"></a>[V2:pg 167]</span> there seemed
at least a chance of replacing the Whig Ministry with a Tory one.
The date for the discussion of the motion had been set for June 30.
On June 13, Lindsay, writing to Slidell, enclosed a letter from
Roebuck asking for an interview with Napoleon<a name=
"FNanchor1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080">[1080]</a>, and on June
16, Mason wrote that if Slidell saw the Emperor it was of the
greatest importance that he, Mason, should be at once informed of
the results and how far he might communicate them to "our friends
in the House<a name="FNanchor1081"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1081">[1081]</a>." Slidell saw the Emperor on June 18,
talked of the possibility of "forcing the English Cabinet to act or
to give way to a new ministry," asked that an interview be given
Lindsay and Roebuck, and hinted that Lord Malmesbury, a warm friend
of the Emperor, would probably be the Foreign Secretary in a Tory
cabinet. Napoleon made no comment indicating any purpose to aid in
upsetting the Palmerston Government; but consented to the requested
interview and declared he would go to the length of officially
informing the British Ministry that France was very ready to
discuss the advisability of recognizing the South<a name=
"FNanchor1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082">[1082]</a>.</p>
<p>This was good news. June 22, Slidell received a note from
Mocquard stating that Baron Gros, the French Ambassador at London,
had been instructed to sound Russell. Meanwhile, Roebuck and
Lindsay had hurried to Paris, June 20, saw Napoleon and on the
twenty-fifth, Slidell reported that they were authorized to state
in the House of Commons that France was "not only willing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_168"></a>[V2:pg 168]</span>
anxious to recognize the Confederate States with the co-operation
of England<a name="FNanchor1083"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1083">[1083]</a>." Slidell added, however, that Napoleon
had not promised Roebuck and Lindsay to make a formal proposal to
Great Britain. This rested on the assurances received by Slidell
from Mocquard, and when Mason, who had let the assurance be known
to his friends, wrote that Russell, replying to Clanricarde, on
June 26, had denied any official communication from France, and
asked for authority from Slidell to back up his statements by being
permitted to give Roebuck a copy of the supposed
instruction<a name="FNanchor1084"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1084">[1084]</a>, he received a reply indicating
confusion somewhere:</p>
<blockquote>"I called yesterday on my friend at the Affaires
Etrangeres on the subject of your note of Saturday: he has just
left me. M.D. de Lh. will not give a copy of his instructions to
Baron Gros--but this is the substance of it. On the 19th he
directed Baron Gros to take occasion to say to leading Members of
Parliament that the Emperor's opinions on the subject of American
affairs were unchanged. That he was disposed with the co-operation
of England immediately to recognize the Confederate States; this
was in the form of a draft letter, not a despatch. On the 22nd, he
officially instructed the Baron to sound <i>Palmerston</i> on the
subject and to inform him of the Emperor's views and wishes. This
was done in consequence of a note from the Emperor, to the
Minister, in which he said, 'Je me demande, s'il ne serait bien
d'avertir Lord Palmerston, que je suis d&eacute;cid&eacute;
&agrave; reconna&icirc;tre le Sud.' This is by far the most
significant thing that the Emperor has said, either to me or to the
others. It renders me comparatively indifferent what England may do
or omit doing. At all events, let Mr. Roebuck press his motion and
make his statement of the Emperor's declaration. Lord Palmerston
will not dare to dispute it and the responsibility of the
continuance of the war will rest entirely upon him. M. Drouyn de
Lhuys has not heard from Baron Gros the result of his interview
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_169"></a>[V2:pg
169]</span> Palmerston. I see that the latter has been unwell and
it is probable that the former had not been able to see him. There
can be no impropriety in Mr. Roebuck's seeing Baron Gros, who will
doubtless give him information which he will use to advantage. I
write in great haste; will you do me the favour to let Lord
Campbell know the substance of this note, omitting that portion of
it which relates to the Emperor's inclination to act alone. Pray
excuse me to Lord Campbell for not writing to him, time not
permitting me to do so<a name="FNanchor1085"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1085">[1085]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This did not satisfy Mason; he telegraphed on the twenty-ninth,
"Can I put in hands of Roebuck copy of Mocquard's note brought by
Corcoran<a name="FNanchor1086"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1086">[1086]</a>." To which Slidell replied by
letter:</p>
<blockquote>"For fear the telegraph may commit some blunder I write
to say that M. Mocquard's note, being confidential, cannot be
<i>used in any way</i>. I showed it to Messrs. Roebuck and Lindsay
when they were here and have no objection that they should again
see it confidentially<a name="FNanchor1087"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1087">[1087]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On June 29, Roebuck went to Baron Gros and received the
information that no formal communication had been made to Russell.
The next day in an effort in some way to secure an admission of
what Mason and his friends believed to be the truth, Lord Campbell
asked Russell in the House of Lords if he had received either a
document or a verbal communication outlining Napoleon's desires.
Russell replied that Baron Gros had told him "an hour ago" that he
had not even received any instruction to deliver such a
communication<a name="FNanchor1088"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1088">[1088]</a>. This was in the hours preceding the
debate, now finally to occur in the Commons. Evidently there had
been an error in the understanding of Napoleon by Slidell, Roebuck
and Lindsay, or else there was a question of veracity between
Russell, Baron Gros and Napoleon.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_170"></a>[V2:pg 170]</span>
<p>Roebuck's motion was couched in the form of a request to the
Queen to enter into negotiations with foreign powers for
co-operation in recognition of the Confederacy. Roebuck argued that
the South had in fact established its independence and that this
was greatly to England's advantage since it put an end to the
"threatening great power" in the West. He repeated old arguments
based on suffering in Lancashire--a point his opponents brushed
aside as no longer of dangerous concern--attacked British
anti-slavery sentiment as mere hypocrisy and minimized the dangers
of a war with the North, prophesying an easy victory for Great
Britain. Then, warmed to the real attack on the Government Roebuck
related at length his interview with Napoleon, claiming to have
been commissioned by the Emperor to urge England to action and
asserting that since Baron Gros had been instructed to apply again
to the British Cabinet it must be evident that the Ministry was
concealing something from Parliament. Almost immediately, however,
he added that Napoleon had told him no formal French application
could be renewed to Great Britain since Russell had revealed to
Seward, through Lyons, the contents of a former application.</p>
<p>Thus following the usual pro-Southern arguments, now somewhat
perfunctorily given, the bolt against the Government had been shot
with all of Roebuck's accustomed "vigour" of utterance<a name=
"FNanchor1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089">[1089]</a>. Here was
direct attack; that it was a futile one early became evident in the
debate. Lord Robert Montagu, while professing himself a friend of
the South, was sarcastic at the expense of Roebuck's entrance into
the field of diplomacy, enlarged upon the real dangers of becoming
involved in the war, and moved an amendment in favour of continued
British neutrality. Palmerston was absent, being ill, but
Gladstone, for the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_171"></a>[V2:pg 171]</span> Government, while carefully
avoiding expressions of sympathy for either North or South, yet
going out of his way to pass a moral judgment on the disaster to
political liberty if the North should wholly crush the South, was
positive in assertion that it would be unwise to adopt either
Roebuck's motion or Montagu's amendment. Great Britain should not
<i>commit</i> herself to any line of policy, especially as military
events were "now occurring" which might greatly alter the whole
situation, though "the main result of the contest was not
doubtful." Here spoke that element of the Ministry still convinced
of ultimate Southern success.</p>
<p>If Gladstone's had been the only reply to Roebuck he and his
friends might well have thought they were about to secure a
ministerial change of front. But it soon appeared that Gladstone
spoke more for himself than for the Government. Roebuck had made a
direct accusation and in meeting this, Layard, for the Foreign
Office, entered a positive and emphatical denial, in which he was
supported by Sir George Grey, Home Secretary, who added sharp
criticism of Roebuck for permitting himself to be made the channel
of a French complaint against England. It early became evident to
the friends of the South that an error in tactics had been
committed and in two directions; first, in the assertion that a new
French offer had been made when it was impossible to present proof
of it; and second, in bringing forward what amounted to an attempt
to unseat the Ministry without previously committing the Tories to
a support of the motion. Apparently Disraeli was simply letting
Roebuck "feel out" the House. The only member of the Tory party
strongly supporting him was Lord Robert Cecil, in a speech so
clearly a mere party one that it served to increase the strength of
ministerial resistance. Friends of the North quickly appreciated
the situation and in strong speeches supported the neutrality
policy of the Government. Forster laid stress upon the danger of
war and the strength <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_172"></a>[V2:pg 172]</span> of British emancipation
sentiment as did Bright in what was, read to-day, the most powerful
of all his parliamentary utterances on the American war. In
particular Bright voiced a general disbelief in the accuracy of
Roebuck's report of his interview with Napoleon, called upon his
"friend" Lindsay for his version<a name="FNanchor1090"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1090">[1090]</a> of the affair, and concluded by
recalling former speeches by Roebuck in which the latter had been
fond of talking about the "perjured lips" of Napoleon. Bright
dilated upon the egotism and insolence of Roebuck in trying to
represent the Emperor of France on the floor of the House of
Commons. The Emperor, he asserted, was in great danger of being too
much represented in Parliament<a name="FNanchor1091"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1091">[1091]</a>.</p>
<p>The result of this first day's debate on June 30 was
disconcerting to Southern friends. It had been adjourned without a
vote, for which they were duly thankful. Especially disconcerting
was Slidell's refusal to permit the citation of Mocquard's note in
proof of Roebuck's assertions. Mason wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"I have your note of 29th ult. You will see in the
papers of to-day the debate in the House last night, at which I was
present, and will have seen what in the H.L. Lord Russell said in
reply to Lord Campbell. Thus the French affair remains in a 'muss,'
unless the Emperor will show his hand <i>on paper</i>, we shall
never know what he really means, or derive any benefit from his
private and individual revelations. As things now stand before the
public, there can be but one opinion, i.e., that he holds one
language in private communications, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_173"></a>[V2:pg 173]</span> though 'with liberty to
divulge,' and another to his ambassador here. The debate is
adjourned to to-morrow night, when Lindsay will give in his
explanation. It would be uncivil to say that I have no confidence
in the Emperor, but certainly what has come from him so far can
invite only distrust<a name="FNanchor1092"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1092">[1092]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>As in Parliament, so in the public press, immediate recognition
of the Confederacy received little support. The <i>Times</i>, while
sympathetic with the purpose was against Roebuck's motion,
considering it of no value unless backed up by force; to this the
<i>Times</i> was decidedly opposed<a name=
"FNanchor1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093">[1093]</a>. Of like
opinion was the <i>Economist</i>, declaring that premature
recognition was a justifiable ground for a declaration of war by
the North<a name="FNanchor1094"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1094">[1094]</a>. July 2, Roebuck asked when the debate
was to be renewed and was told that must wait on Palmerston's
recovery and return to the House. Bright pressed for an immediate
decision. Layard reaffirmed very positively that no communication
had been received from France and disclosed that Napoleon's alleged
complaint of a British revelation to Seward of French overtures was
a myth, since the document in question had been printed in the
<i>Moniteur</i>, thus attracting Seward's attention<a name=
"FNanchor1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095">[1095]</a>. Thus
Roebuck was further discredited. July 4, Spence wrote strongly
urging the withdrawal of the motion:</p>
<blockquote>"I have a letter from an eminent member of the House
and great friend of the South urging the danger of carrying Mr.
Roebuck's motion to a vote. It is plain it will be defeated by a
great majority and the effect of this will encourage the North and
distress our friends. It will also strengthen the minority of the
Cabinet in favour of the North....<br>
<br>
"The fact is the ground of the motion, which was action on the part
of France, has failed us--and taken shape which tells injuriously
instead of being the great support....<br>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_174"></a>[V2:pg 174]</span>
"If a positive engagement were made by Mr. Disraeli to support the
motion it would alter the question entirely. In the absence of this
I fear the vote would be humiliating and would convey an impression
wholly delusive, for the members are 10 to 1 in favour of the South
and yet on this point the vote might be 5 to 1 against Southern
interests<a name="FNanchor1096"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1096">[1096]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On July 6, Palmerston was back in the House and Roebuck secured
an agreement for a resumption of the debate on "Monday next<a name=
"FNanchor1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097">[1097]</a>." Meantime
many powerful organs of the French press had taken up the matter
and were full of sharp criticism of Napoleon's supposed policy and
actions as stated by Roebuck. The effect in England was to create a
feeling that Napoleon might have difficulty in carrying out a
pro-Southern policy<a name="FNanchor1098"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1098">[1098]</a>. Palmerston, wishing to avoid further
discussion on Napoleon's share in providing fuel for the debate,
wrote in a very conciliatory and pleasant way to Roebuck, on July
9:</p>
<blockquote>"Perhaps you will allow me thus privately to urge upon
you, and through you upon Mr. Lindsay, the expediency of dropping
altogether, whether your debate goes on or not, all further mention
or discussion of what passed between you and Mr. Lindsay on the one
hand, and the Emperor of the French on the other. In truth the
whole proceeding on this subject the other day seems to me to have
been very irregular. The British Parliament receives messages and
communications from their own sovereign, but not from the
sovereigns of other countries...."<br>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_175"></a>[V2:pg 175]</span>
"No good can come of touching again upon this matter, nor from
fixing upon the Emperor a mistake which amid the multiplicity of
things he has to think of he may be excused for making. I am very
anxious that neither you nor Mr. Lindsay should mention those
matters any more, as any discussion about them must tend to impair
the good relations between the French and English Governments.
Might I ask you to show this note to Mr. Lindsay, your fellow
traveller<a name="FNanchor1099"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1099">[1099]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The next day, in the Commons, Sir James Ferguson appealed to
Roebuck to withdraw his motion altogether as inexpedient, because
of the uncertainty of events in America and as sure to be defeated
if pressed to a vote. Palmerston approved this suggestion and urged
that if the debate be continued speakers should refrain from all
further mention of the personal questions that had been raised,
since these were not proper matters for discussion in the House and
were embarrassing to the French Emperor. But Palmerston's skill in
management was unavailing in this case and the "muss" (as Mason
called it) was continued when Lindsay entered upon a long account
of the interview with Napoleon, renewed the accusations of
Russell's "revelations" to Seward and advised Roebuck not to
withdraw his motion but to postpone it "until Monday." The
<i>Scotia</i>, he said was due and any moment news from America
might change the governmental policy. Again the fat was in the
fire. Palmerston sharply disavowed that news would change policy.
Kinglake thought Roebuck's actions should be thoroughly
investigated. Forster eagerly pressed for continuation of the
debate. There was a general criticism of Roebuck's "diplomacy," and
of Lindsay's also. Northern friends were jubilant and those of the
South embarrassed and uncertain. Gregory believed that the motion
should be withdrawn "in the interest of the South," but Lord Robert
Cecil renewed Lindsay's advice <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_176"></a>[V2:pg 176]</span> to wait "until Monday" and this
was finally done<a name="FNanchor1100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1100">[1100]</a>.</p>
<p>All England was in fact eagerly waiting for news from America.
Lee's advance was known to have passed by Washington, but no
reports were yet at hand of the battle which must determine this
first great offensive campaign by the South. July 9, the
<i>Times</i> predicted, editorially, that Lee was about to capture
Washington and that this event would be met by a great cry of joy
and relief in the North, now weary of the war and eager to escape
from the despotism of Lincoln's administration<a name=
"FNanchor1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101">[1101]</a>.
Nevertheless the <i>Times</i>, while still confident of Lee's
victorious advance and of the welcome likely to be accorded him in
the North, came out strongly on July 13 in an appeal to Roebuck to
withdraw his motion, arguing that even if he were successful Great
Britain ought to make no hurried change of policy<a name=
"FNanchor1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102">[1102]</a>. On this
day, the thirteenth, Roebuck moved the discharge <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_177"></a>[V2:pg 177]</span> of his motion
in a speech so mild as to leave the impression that "Tear 'em" had
his tail between his legs but, Lindsay, his feelings evidently
injured by the aspersions cast upon his own "amateur diplomacy,"
spoke at much length of the interview with Napoleon and tried to
show that on a previous occasion he had been, in fact, "employed"
by the Government. Palmerston was pithy and sarcastic in reply.
Lindsay, he said, had "employed" himself. He hoped that this would
be the "last time when any member of this House shall think it his
duty to communicate to the British House of Commons that which may
have passed between himself and the Sovereign of a foreign
country<a name="FNanchor1103"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1103">[1103]</a>."</p>
<p>The entire debate on Roebuck's motion was a serious blow to the
cause of the South in Parliament. Undertaken on a complete
misunderstanding of the position of Tory leaders, begun with a
vehemence that led its mover into tactical error, it rapidly
dwindled to a mere question of personal veracity and concluded in
sharp reproof from the Government. No doubt the very success (so it
seemed at the moment) of Southern arms, upon which Roebuck counted
to support his motion was, in actual effect, a deterrent, since
many Southern sympathizers thought Great Britain might now keep
hands off since the South was "winning anyway." There is no
evidence that Russell thought this, or that he was moved by any
consideration save the fixed determination to remain neutral--even
to the extent of reversing a previous decision as to the powers of
the Government in relation to Southern ship-building.</p>
<p>Roebuck withdrew his motion, not because of any imminent
Southern victory, but because he knew that if pressed to a vote it
would be overwhelmingly defeated. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_178"></a>[V2:pg 178]</span> The debate was the last one of
importance on the topics of mediation or recognition<a name=
"FNanchor1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104">[1104]</a>. News of
Lee's check at Gettysburg reached London on July 16, but was
described by the <i>Times</i> two days later as virtually a
Southern victory since the Northern army had been compelled to act
wholly on the defensive. In the same issue it was stated of
Vicksburg, "it is difficult to see what possible hope there can be
of reducing the city<a name="FNanchor1105"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1105">[1105]</a>." But on July 20, full news of the
events of July 4, when Vicksburg fell and Lee began his retreat
from Gettysburg, was received and its significance acknowledged,
though efforts were made to prove that these events simply showed
that neither side could conquer the other<a name=
"FNanchor1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106">[1106]</a>. In
contradiction of previous assertions that "another Vicksburg" might
easily be set up to oppose Northern advance in the west there was
now acknowledgment that the capture of this one remaining barrier
on the Mississippi was a great disaster to the South. <i>The
Index</i>, forgetful that it was supposedly a British publication,
declared: "The saddest news which has reached <i>us</i> since the
fall of New Orleans is the account of the surrender of Vicksburg.
The <i>very day</i> on which the capitulation took place renders
the blow heavier<a name="FNanchor1107"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1107">[1107]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_179"></a>[V2:pg 179]</span>
<p>"The fall of Vicksburg," wrote Spence, "has made me ill all the
week, never yet being able to drive it off my mind<a name=
"FNanchor1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108">[1108]</a>." Adams
reported that the news had caused a panic among the holders of the
Cotton Loan bonds and that the press and upper classes were
exceedingly glad they had refused support of Roebuck's
motion<a name="FNanchor1109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1109">[1109]</a>.</p>
<p>If July, 1863, may in any way be regarded as the "crisis" of
Southern effort in England, it is only as a despairing one doomed
to failure from the outset, and receiving a further severe set-back
by the ill-fortune of Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania. The real
crisis of governmental attitude had long since passed. Naturally
this was not acknowledged by the staunch friends of the South any
more than at Richmond it was acknowledged (or understood) that
Gettysburg marked the crisis of the Confederacy. But that the end
of Southern hope for British intervention had come at Richmond, was
made clear by the action of Benjamin, the Confederate Secretary of
State. On August 4, he recalled Mason, writing that the recent
debates in Parliament showed the Government determined not to
receive him:</p>
<blockquote>"Under these circumstances, your continued residence in
London is neither conducive to the interests nor consistent with
the dignity of this Government, and the President therefore
requests that you consider your mission at an end, and that you
withdraw, with your secretary, from London<a name=
"FNanchor1110"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1110">[1110]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>A private letter accompanying the instruction authorized Mason
to remain if there were any "marked change" in governmental
attitude, but since the decision of the Ministry to seize the Laird
Rams had been made public at nearly the same moment when this
instruction was received, September <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_180"></a>[V2:pg 180]</span> 15, Mason could hardly fail to
retire promptly. Indeed, the very fact of that seizure gave
opportunity for a dramatic exit though there was no connection
between Benjamin's instruction and the stopping of Confederate
ship-building in England. The real connection was with the failure
of the Gettysburg campaign and the humiliating collapse of
Roebuck's motion. Even the <i>Times</i> was now expanding upon the
"serious reverses" of the South and making it clearly understood
that England "has not had and will not have the slightest
inclination to intervention or mediation, or to take any position
except that of strict neutrality<a name="FNanchor1111"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1111">[1111]</a>."</p>
<p>Mason at once notified Slidell of his receipt of the recall
instruction and secured the latter's approval of the communication
he proposed making to Russell<a name="FNanchor1112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1112">[1112]</a>. A general consultation of Southern
agents took place and Mason would have been vexed had he known how
small was the regard for his abilities as a diplomat<a name=
"FNanchor1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113">[1113]</a>. <i>The
Index</i> hastened to join in a note already struck at Richmond of
warm welcome to France in her conquest of Mexico, reprinting on
September 17, an editorial from the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> in
which it was declared, "France is the only Power in the world that
has manifested any friendly feeling towards the Confederacy in its
terrible struggle for independence." Evidently all hope was now
centred upon Napoleon, a conclusion without doubt distasteful to
Mason and one which he was loth to accept as final.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_181"></a>[V2:pg 181]</span>
<p>On September 21, Mason notified Russell of his withdrawal very
nearly in the words of Benjamin's instruction. The news was at once
made public, calling out from the <i>Times</i> a hectoring
editorial on the folly of the South in demanding recognition before
it had won it<a name="FNanchor1114"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1114">[1114]</a>. In general, however, the press took a
tone apparently intended to "let Mason down easily," acknowledging
that his act indicated a universal understanding that Great Britain
would not alter her policy of strict neutrality, but expressing
admiration for the courage and confidence of the South<a name=
"FNanchor1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115">[1115]</a>. September
25, Russell replied to Mason with courtesy but also with seeming
finality:</p>
<blockquote>"I have on other occasions explained to you the reasons
which have induced Her Majesty's Government to decline the
overtures you allude to, and the motives which have hitherto
prevented the British Court from recognizing you as the accredited
Minister of an established State.<br>
<br>
"These reasons are still in force, and it is not necessary to
repeat them.<br>
<br>
"I regret that circumstances have prevented my cultivating your
personal acquaintance, which, in a different state of affairs, I
should have done with much pleasure and satisfaction<a name=
"FNanchor1116"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1116">[1116]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thus Mason took his exit. Brief entrances upon the stage in
England were still to be his, but the chief r&ocirc;le there was
now assigned to others and the principal scenes transferred to
France. That Mason did not fully concur in this as final, easily as
it was accepted by Slidell, is evident from his later
correspondence with Lindsay and Spence. He regarded the question of
British recognition of the South as mainly an English political
question, pinning his hopes on a Tory overthrow of Palmerston's
Ministry. This he <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_182"></a>[V2:pg 182]</span> believed to depend on the life
of the Prime Minister and his anxious inquiries as to the health of
Palmerston were frequent. Nothing in his instructions indicated a
desired course of action and Mason after consulting Slidell and,
naturally, securing his acquiescence, determined to remain in
Europe waiting events.</p>
<p>If the South was indignant at British inaction the North was
correspondingly pleased and after the seizure of the Laird Rams was
officially very friendly--at least so Lyons reported<a name=
"FNanchor1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117">[1117]</a>. In this
same private letter, however, Lyons ventured a strong protest
against a notion which now seems to have occurred to Russell of
joint action by England, France and Spain to withdraw belligerent
rights <i>to the North</i>, unless the United States formally
"concede to their enemy the status of a Belligerent for all
<i>international</i> purposes." Why or how this idea came to be
taken up by Russell is uncertain. Possibly it was the result of
irritation created by the persistence of Seward in denying that the
war was other than an effort to crush rebellious subjects--theory
clearly against the fact yet consistently maintained by the
American Secretary of State throughout the entire war and
constantly causing difficulties in relations with neutral
countries. At any rate Lyons was quick to see the danger. He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Such a declaration might produce a furious outburst of
wrath from Government and public here. It cannot, however, be
denied that the reasoning on which the Declaration would be founded
would be incontrovertible, and that in the end firmness answers
better with the Americans than coaxing. But then England, France
and Spain must be really firm, and not allow their Declaration to
be a <i>brutum fulmen</i>. If on its being met, as it very probably
would be, by a decided refusal on the part of the United States,
they did not proceed to break up the Blockade, or at all events to
resist by force the exercise of the right of visit on the high
seas, the United <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_183"></a>[V2:pg 183]</span> States Government and people
would become more difficult to deal with than ever. I find,
however, that I am going beyond my own province, and I will
therefore add only an excuse for doing so<a name=
"FNanchor1118"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1118">[1118]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lyons followed this up a week later by a long description of
America's readiness for a foreign war, a situation very different
from that of 1861. America, he said, had steadily been preparing
for such a contingency not with any desire for it but that she
might not be caught napping<a name="FNanchor1119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1119">[1119]</a>. This was written as if merely an
interesting general speculation and was accompanied by the
assurance, "I don't think the Government here at all desires to
pick a quarrel with us or with any European Power--but the better
prepared it is, the less manageable it will be<a name=
"FNanchor1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120">[1120]</a>."
Nevertheless, Lyons' concern over Russell's motion of withdrawing
belligerent rights to the North was great, and his representations
presumably had effect, for no more was heard of the matter. Russell
relieved Lyons' mind by writing, November 21:</p>
<blockquote>"I hope you continue to go on quietly with Seward. I
think this is better than any violent demonstrations of friendship
which might turn sour like beer if there should be a
thunder-storm.<br>
<br>
"But I am more and more persuaded that amongst the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_184"></a>[V2:pg 184]</span> Powers with
whose Ministers I pass my time there is none with whom our
relations ought to be so frank and cordial as the United
States<a name="FNanchor1121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1121">[1121]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>If relations with the North were now to be so "frank and
cordial," there was, indeed, little remaining hope possible to
English friends of the South. Bright wrote to Sumner: "Neutrality
is agreed upon by all, and I hope a more fair and friendly
neutrality than we have seen during the past two years<a name=
"FNanchor1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122">[1122]</a>." George
Thompson, at Exeter Hall, lauding Henry Ward Beecher for his speech
there, commented on the many crowded open public meetings in favour
of the North as compared with the two pro-Southern ones in London,
slimly and privately attended<a name="FNanchor1123"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1123">[1123]</a>. Jefferson Davis, in addressing the
Confederate Congress, December 7, was bitter upon the "unfair and
deceptive conduct" of England<a name="FNanchor1124"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1124">[1124]</a>. Adams, by mid-December, 1863, was sure
that previous British confidence in the ultimate success of the
South was rapidly declining<a name="FNanchor1125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1125">[1125]</a>.</p>
<p>Such utterances, if well founded, might well have portended the
cessation of further Southern effort in England. That a renewal of
activity soon occurred was due largely to a sudden shift in the
military situation in America and to the realization that the
heretofore largely negative support given to the Southern cause
must be replaced by organized and persistent effort. Grant's
victorious progress in the West had been checked by the disaster to
Rosencrans at Chicamauga, September 18, and Grant's army forced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_185"></a>[V2:pg 185]</span>
retrace its steps to recover Chattanooga. It was not until November
24 that the South was compelled to release its grip upon that city.
Meanwhile in the East, Lee, fallen back to his old lines before
Richmond, presented a still impregnable front to Northern advance.
No sudden collapse, such as had been expected, followed the
Southern defeats at Vicksburg and Gettysburg. Again the contest
presented the appearance of a drawn battle. Small wonder then that
McHenry, confident in his statistics, should now declare that at
last cotton was to become in truth King<a name=
"FNanchor1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126">[1126]</a>, and count
much upon the effect of the arguments advanced in his recently
published book<a name="FNanchor1127"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1127">[1127]</a>. Small wonder that Southern friends
should hurry the organization of the "Southern Independence
Association." Seeking a specific point of attack and again hoping
for Tory support they first fixed their attention on the new trial
of the <i>Alexandra</i>, on appeal from the decision by the Chief
Baron of the Court of Exchequer. On December 4, Lindsay wrote to
Mason that he had daily been "journeying to town" with the "old
Chief Baron" and was confident the Government would again be
defeated--in which case it would be very open to attack for the
seizure of the Rams also. Nevertheless he was emphatic in his
caution to Mason not to place too high a hope on any change in
Government policy or on any expectation that the Tories would
replace Palmerston<a name="FNanchor1128"></a><a href=

The active agent in control of the <i>Index</i> was Henry Hotze,
who, in addition to managing this journal, used secret service
funds of the Confederacy to secure the support of writers in the
London press. He was in close touch with all the Southern agents
sent to Europe at various times, but appears never to have been
fully trusted by either Mason or Slidell. In 1912-13 I made notes
from various materials originating with Hotze, these being then in
the possession of Mr. Charles Francis Adams. These materials were
(1) a letter and cash book marked "C.S.A. Commercial Agency,
London"; (2) a copy despatch book, January 6, 1862, to December 31,
1864; (3) a copy letter-book of drafts of "private" letters, May
28, 1864, to June 16, 1865. All these materials were secured by Mr.
Adams from Professor J.F. Jameson, who had received them from Henry
Vignaud. Since Mr. Adams' death in 1915 no trace of these Hotze
materials has been found. My references, then, to "Hotze Papers,"
must rest on my notes, and transcripts of many letters, taken in
1912-13. Describing his activities to Benjamin, Hotze stated that
in addition to maintaining the <i>Index</i>, he furnished news
items and <i>editorials</i> to various London papers, had seven
paid writers on these papers, and was a pretty constant distributor
of "boxes of cigars imported from Havana ... American whiskey and
other articles." He added: "It is, of course, out of the question
to give vouchers." (Hotze Papers MS. Letter Book. Hotze to
Benjamin, No. 19, March 14, 1863.) In Hotze's cash book one of his
regular payees was Percy Gregg who afterwards wrote a history of
the Confederacy. Hotze complained that he could get no "paid
writer" on the <i>Times</i>.</blockquote>

"#FNanchor1101">[1101]</a> In the same issue appeared a letter from
the New York correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, containing a
similar prediction but in much stronger terms. For the last half of
the war the <i>Times</i> was badly served by this correspondent who
invariably reported the situation from an extreme anti-Northern
point of view. This was Charles Mackay who served the <i>Times</i>
in New York from March, 1862, to December, 1865. (Mackay, <i>Forty
Years' Recollections</i>, II, p. 412.) Possibly he had strict
instructions. During this same week Lyons, writing privately to
Russell, minimized the "scare" about Lee's advance. He reported
that Mercier had ordered up a war-ship to take him away if
Washington should fall. Lyons cannily decided such a step for
himself inadvisable, since it would irritate Seward and in case the
unexpected happened he could no doubt get passage on Mercier's
ship. When news came of the Southern defeat at Gettysburg and of
Grant's capture of Vicksburg, Lyons thought the complete collapse
of the Confederacy an imminent possibility. Leslie Stephen is a
witness to the close relations of Seward and Lyons at this time. He
visited Washington about a month after Gettysburg and met Seward,
being received with much cordiality as a <i>verbal</i> champion in
England of the North. (He had as yet published no signed articles
on the war.) In this conversation he was amused that Seward spoke
of the friendly services of "Monkton Mill," as a publicist on
political economy. (Maitland, <i>Leslie Stephen</i>, p.

more enthusiastic multitude than ever assembled on the Continent of
America." The New York city which soon after indulged in the "draft
riots" might give some ground for such writing, but it was far
fetched, nevertheless--and New York was not the North.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SOUTHERN INDEPENDENCE ASSOCIATION</h3>
<br>
<p>Northern friends in England were early active in organizing
public meetings and after the second emancipation proclamation of
January 1, 1863, these became both numerous and notable. Southern
friends, confident in the ultimate success of the Confederacy and
equally confident that they had with them the great bulk of
upper-class opinion in England, at first thought it unnecessary to
be active in public expressions aside from such as were made
through the newspapers. Up to November, 1862, <i>The Index</i>
records no Southern public meeting. But by the summer of 1863, the
indefatigable Spence had come to the conclusion that something must
be done to offset the efforts of Bright and others, especially in
the manufacturing districts where a strong Northern sympathy had
been created. On June 16, he wrote to Mason that on his initiative
a Southern Club had been organized in Manchester and that others
were now forming in Oldham, Blackburn and Stockport. In Manchester
the Club members had "smashed up the last Abolitionist meeting in
the Free Trade Hall":</p>
<blockquote>"These parties are not the rich spinners but young men
of energy with a taste for agitation but little money. It appears
to my judgment that it would be wise not to stint money in aiding
this effort to expose cant and diffuse the truth. Manchester is
naturally the centre of such a move and you will see there are here
the germs of important work--but they need to be tended and
fostered. I have supplied <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_187"></a>[V2:pg 187]</span> a good deal of money
individually but I see room for the use of &pound;30 or &pound;40 a
month or more<a name="FNanchor1129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1129">[1129]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The appeal for funds (though Spence wrote that he would advance
the required amounts on the chance of reimbursement from the
Confederate secret service fund) is interesting in comparison with
the contributions willingly made by Bright's friends. "Young men of
energy with a taste for agitation but little money" reveals a
source of support somewhat dubious in persistent zeal and requiring
more than a heavy list of patrons' names to keep up a public
interest. Nevertheless, Spence succeeded, for a short time, in
arousing a show of energy. November 24, 1863, Mason wrote to Mann
that measures were "in progress and in course of execution" to hold
public meetings, memorialize Parliament, and form an association
for the promotion of Southern independence "under the auspices of
such men as the Marquis of Lothian, Lord Robert Cecil, M.P., Lord
Wharncliffe, Lord Eustace Cecil, Messrs. Haliburton, Lindsay,
Peacocke, Van Stittart, M.P., Beresford Hope, Robert Bourke, and
others<a name="FNanchor1130"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1130">[1130]</a>...." A fortnight later, Spence reported
his efforts and postulated that in them, leading to European
intervention, lay the principal, if not the only hope, of Southern
independence--a view never <i>publicly</i> acknowledged by any
devoted friend of the South:</p>
<blockquote>"The news is gloomy--very, and I really do not see how
the war is to be worked out to success without the action of
Europe. That is stopped by our Government but there is a power that
will move the latter, if it can only be stirred up, and that, of
course, is public opinion. I had a most agreeable and successful
visit to Glasgow upon a requisition signed by the citizens. The
enemy placarded the walls and brought all their forces to the
meeting, in which out of 4,000 I think they were fully 1,000
strong, but we beat them completely, carrying a resolution which
embraced a memorial <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_188"></a>[V2:pg 188]</span> to Lord Palmerston. We have now
carried six public meetings, Sheffield, Oldham, Stockport, Preston,
Ashton, Glasgow. We have three to come off now ready, Burnley,
Bury, Macclesfield, and others in preparation. My plan is to work
up through the secondary towns to the chief ones and take the
latter, Liverpool, Manchester, London, etc., as we come upon the
assembling of Parliament.... By dint of perseverance I think we
shall succeed. The problem is simply to convert latent into active
sympathy. There is ample power on our side to move the
Cabinet--divided as it is, if we can only arouse that power. At any
rate the object is worth the effort<a name=
"FNanchor1131"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1131">[1131]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In the month of November, <i>The Index</i> began to report these
meetings. In nearly all, Northern partisans were present, attempted
to heckle the speakers, and usually presented amendments to the
address which were voted down. Spence was given great credit for
his energy, being called "indefatigable":</p>
<blockquote>"The commencement of the session will see Parliament
flooded with petitions from every town and from every mill
throughout the North. A loud protest will arise against the
<i>faineant</i> policy which declines to interfere while men of
English blood are uselessly murdering each other by thousands, and
while England's most important manufacture is thereby ruined.... It
remains to be seen whether the voice of the North will have any
effect upon the policy of the Government<a name=
"FNanchor1132"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1132">[1132]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>By "the North" was meant the manufacturing districts and an
explanation was made of the difficulty of similar efforts in London
because it was really a "congeries of cities," with no such
solidarity of interests as characterized "the North<a name=
"FNanchor1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133">[1133]</a>." Without
London, however, the movement <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_189"></a>[V2:pg 189]</span> lacked driving force and it was
determined to create there an association which should become the
main-spring of further activities. Spence, Beresford Hope, and Lord
Eustace Cecil were made a committee to draft a plan and preliminary
address. Funds were now forthcoming from the big blockade-running
firms</p>
<blockquote>"Some time ago I saw friend Collie, who had made a
terrific sum of money, and told him he must come out for the cause
in proportion thereto. To this he responded like a brick, I was
near saying, but I mean Briton--by offering at once to devote a
percentage of cotton out of each steamer that runs the blockade, to
the good of the cause. He has given me at once &pound;500 on
account of this--which I got to-day in a cheque and have sent on to
Lord Eustace Cecil, our treasurer. Thus, you see, we are fairly
afloat there<a name="FNanchor1134"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1134">[1134]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Yet Spence was fighting against fear that all this agitation was
too late:</p>
<blockquote>"Nevertheless it is not to be disguised that the evil
tidings make uphill work of it--very. Public opinion has quite
veered round to the belief that the South will be exhausted. The
<i>Times</i> correspondent's letters do great harm--more especially
Gallenga's--who replaced Chas. Mackay at New York. I have, however,
taken a berth for Mackay by Saturday's boat, so he will soon be out
again and he is dead for our side<a name=
"FNanchor1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135">[1135]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Again Spence asserted the one great hope to be in European
intervention:</p>
<blockquote>"I am now clear in my own mind that unless we get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_190"></a>[V2:pg 190]</span>
Europe to move--or some improbable convulsion occur in the
North--the end will be a sad one. It seems to me therefore,
impossible that too strenuous an effort can be made to move our
Government and I cannot understand the Southerners who say: 'Oh,
what can you make of it?' I have known a man brought back to life
two hours after he seemed stone-dead--the efforts at first seemed
hopeless, but in case of life or death what effort should be
spared<a name="FNanchor1136"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1136">[1136]</a>?"</blockquote>
<p>The Manchester Southern Club was the most active of those
organized by Spence and was the centre for operations in the
manufacturing districts. On December 15, a great gathering (as
described by <i>The Index</i>) took place there with delegates from
many of the near-by towns<a name="FNanchor1137"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1137">[1137]</a>. Forster referred to this and other
meetings as "spasmodic and convulsive efforts being made by
Southern Clubs to cause England to interfere in American
affairs<a name="FNanchor1138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1138">[1138]</a>," but the enthusiasm at Manchester was
unquestioned and plans were on foot to bombard with petitions the
Queen, Palmerston, Russell and others in authority, but more
especially the members of Parliament as a body. These petitions
were "in process of being signed in every town and almost in every
cotton-mill throughout the district<a name=
"FNanchor1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139">[1139]</a>." It was
high time for London, if it was desired that she should lead and
<i>control</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_191"></a>[V2:pg
191]</span> these activities, to perfect her own Club. "Next week,"
wrote Lindsay, on January 8, 1864, it would be formally launched
under the name of "The Southern Independence Association<a name=
"FNanchor1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140">[1140]</a>," and would
be in working order before the reassembling of Parliament.</p>
<p>The organization of meetings by Spence and the formation of the
Southern Independence Association were attempts to do for the South
what Bright and others had done earlier and so successfully for the
North. Tardily the realization had come that public opinion, even
though but slightly represented in Parliament, was yet a powerful
weapon with which to influence the Government. Unenfranchised
England now received from Southern friends a degree of attention
hitherto withheld from it by those gentry who had been confident
that the goodwill of the bulk of their own class was sufficient
support to the Southern cause. Early in the war one little Southern
society had indeed been organized, but on so diffident a basis as
almost to escape notice. This was the <i>London Confederate States
Aid Association</i> which came to the attention of Adams and his
friends in December, 1862, through the attendance at an early
meeting of one, W.A. Jackson ("Jefferson Davis' ex-coachman"), who
reported the proceedings to George Thompson. The meeting was held
at 3 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, was attended by some fifty
persons and was addressed by Dr. Lempriere. A Mr. Beals, evidently
an unwelcome guest, interrupted the speaker, was forcibly ejected
by a policeman and got revenge by arranging a demonstration against
Mason (who was present), confronting him, on leaving the house,
with a placard showing a negro in chains<a name=
"FNanchor1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141">[1141]</a>. There was
no "public effort" contemplated in such a meeting, although funds
were to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_192"></a>[V2:pg
192]</span> solicited to aid the South. Adams reported the
Association as a sort of Club planning to hold regular Wednesday
evening meetings of its members, the dues being a shilling a week
and the rules providing for loss of membership for
non-attendance<a name="FNanchor1142"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1142">[1142]</a>.</p>
<p>Nothing more is heard of this Association after December, 1862.
Possibly its puerilities killed it and in any case it was not
intended to appeal to the public<a name="FNanchor1143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1143">[1143]</a>. But the launching of the Southern
Independence Association betokened the new policy of constructive
effort in London to match and guide that already started in the
provinces. A long and carefully worded constitution and address
depicted the heroic struggles of the Confederates and the "general
sympathy" of England for their cause; dwelt upon the "governmental
tyranny, corruption in high places, ruthlessness in war,
untruthfulness of speech, and causeless animosity toward Great
Britain" of the North; and declared that the interests of America
and of the world would be best served by the independence of the
South. The effect of a full year's penetration in England of
Lincoln's emancipation proclamation is shown in the necessity felt
by the framers of this constitution to meet that issue. This
required delicate handling and was destined to cause some
heart-burnings. The concluding section of the constitution
read:</p>
<blockquote>"The Association will also devote itself to the
cultivation of kindly feelings between the people of Great Britain
and of the Confederate States; and it will, in particular, steadily
but kindly represent to the Southern States, that recognition by
Europe must necessarily lead to a revision of the system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_193"></a>[V2:pg 193]</span> of
servile labour, unhappily bequeathed to them by England, in
accordance with the spirit of the age, so as to combine the gradual
extinction of slavery with the preservation of property, the
maintenance of the civil polity, and the true civilization of the
negro race<a name="FNanchor1144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1144">[1144]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The Association was unquestionably armed with distinguished guns
of heavy calibre in its Committee and officers, and its membership
fee (one guinea annually) was large enough to attract the
&eacute;lite, but it remained to be seen whether all this equipment
would be sent into action. As yet the vigour of the movement was
centred at Manchester and even there a curious situation soon
arose. Spence in various speeches, was declaring that the "Petition
to Parliament" movement was spreading rapidly. 30,000 at Ashton, he
said, had agreed to memoralize the Government. But on January 30,
1864, Mason Jones, a pro-Northern speaker in the Free Trade Hall at
Manchester, asked why Southern public meetings had come to a halt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_194"></a>[V2:pg 194]</span>
"The Southerners," he declared, "had taken the Free Trade Hall in
the outset with that intention and they were obliged to pay the
rent of the room, though they did not use it. They knew that their
resolutions would be outvoted and that amendments would pass
against them<a name="FNanchor1145"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1145">[1145]</a>." There must have been truth in the
taunt for while <i>The Index</i> in nearly every issue throughout
the middle of 1864 reports great activity there, it does not give
any account of a public meeting. The reports were of many
applications for membership "from all quarters, from persons of
rank and gentlemen of standing in their respective counties<a name=
"FNanchor1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146">[1146]</a>."</p>
<p>Just here lay the weakness of the Southern Independence
Association programme. It <i>did</i> appeal to "persons of rank and
gentlemen of standing," but by the very fact of the flocking to it
of these classes it precluded appeal to Radical and working-class
England--already largely committed to the cause of the North.
Goldwin Smith, in his "Letter to a Whig Member of the Southern
Independence Association," made the point very clear<a name=
"FNanchor1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147">[1147]</a>. In this
pamphlet, probably the strongest presentation of the Northern side
and the most severe castigation of Southern sympathizers that
appeared throughout the whole war, Smith appealed to old Whig ideas
of political liberty, attacked the aristocracy and the Church of
England, and attempted to make the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_195"></a>[V2:pg 195]</span> Radicals of England feel that
the Northern cause was their cause. Printing the constitution and
address of the Association, with the list of signers, he
characterized the movement as fostered by "men of title and
family," with "a good sprinkling of clergymen," and as having for
its object the plunging of Great Britain into war with the
North<a name="FNanchor1148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1148">[1148]</a>.</p>
<p>It is significant, in view of Mason Jones' taunt to the Southern
Independence Association at Manchester, that <i>The Index</i>, from
the end of March to August, 1864, was unable to report a single
Southern public meeting. The London Association, having completed
its top-heavy organization, was content with that act and showed no
life. The first move by the Association was planned to be made in
connection with the <i>Alexandra</i> case when, as was expected,
the Exchequer Court should render a decision against the
Government's right to detain her. On January 8, 1864, Lindsay wrote
to Mason that he had arranged for the public launching of the
Association "next week," that he had again seen the Chief Baron who
assured him the Court would decide "that the Government is entirely
wrong":</p>
<blockquote>"I told him that if the judgment was clear, and if the
Government persisted in proceeding further, that our Association
(which he was pleased to learn had been formed) would take up the
matter in Parliament and out of it, for if we had no right to seize
these ships, it was most unjust that we should detain them by
raising legal quibbles for the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_196"></a>[V2:pg 196]</span> purpose of keeping them here
till the time arrived when the South might not require them. I
think public opinion will go with us on this point, for John
Bull--with all his failings--loves fair play<a name=
"FNanchor1149"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1149">[1149]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>It is apparent from the language used by Lindsay that he was
thinking of the Laird Rams and other ships fully as much as of the
<i>Alexandra</i><a name="FNanchor1150"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1150">[1150]</a>, and hoped much from an attack on the
Government's policy in detaining Southern vessels. Earl Russell was
to be made to bear the brunt of this attack on the reassembling of
Parliament. In an <i>Index</i> editorial, Adams was pictured as
having driven Russell into a corner by "threats which would not
have been endured for an hour by a Pitt or a Canning"; the Foreign
Secretary as invariably yielding to the "acknowledged mastery of
the Yankee Minister":</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Adams' pretensions are extravagant, his logic is
blundering, his threats laughable; but he has hit his mark. We can
trace his influence in the detention of the <i>Alexandra</i> and
the protracted judicial proceedings which have arisen out of it; in
the sudden raid upon the rams at Birkenhead; in the announced
intention of the Government to alter the Foreign Enlistment Act of
this country in accordance with the views of the United States
Cabinet. When one knows the calibre of Mr. Adams one feels inclined
to marvel at his success. The astonishment ceases when one reflects
that the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs is Earl
Russell<a name="FNanchor1151"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1151">[1151]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But when, on February 23, the debate on the Laird Rams
occurred<a name="FNanchor1152"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1152">[1152]</a>, the Tory leaders, upon whom Lindsay
and others depended to drive home the meaning of the
<i>Alexandra</i> decision, carefully avoided urging the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_197"></a>[V2:pg 197]</span> to
change its policy and contented themselves with an effort, very
much in line with that initiated by <i>The Index</i>, to belittle
Russell as yielding to a threat. Adams was even applauded by the
Tories for his discretion and his anxiety to keep the two countries
out of war. The Southern Independence Association remained
quiescent. Very evidently someone, presumably Derby or Disraeli,
had put a quietus on the plan to make an issue of the stoppage of
Southern ship-building. Russell's reply to his accusers was but a
curt denial without going into details, in itself testimony that he
had no fear of a party attack on the <i>policy</i> of stopping the
ships. He was disgusted with the result of the <i>Alexandra</i>
trial and in conversation with Adams reflected upon "the
uncertainty and caprice incident everywhere to the administration
of justice<a name="FNanchor1153"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1153">[1153]</a>."</p>
<p>As between Russell and Seward the waters formerly troubled by
the stiff manner and tone of the one statesman and the flamboyance
of the other were now unusually calm. Russell was less officious
and less eager to protest on minor matters and Seward was less
belligerent in language. Seward now radiated supreme confidence in
the ultimate victory of the North. He had heard rumours of a
movement to be made in Parliament for interposition to bring the
war to an end by a reunion of North and South on a basis of
Abolition and of a Northern assumption of the Confederate debts.
Commenting on this to Lyons he merely remarked that the Northern
answer could be put briefly as: (1) determination to crush
rebellion by force of arms and resentment of any "interposition";
(2) the slaves were already free and would not be made the subject
of any bargain; (3) "As to the Confederate debt the United States,
Mr. Seward said, would never pay a dollar of it<a name=
"FNanchor1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154">[1154]</a>." That there
was public animosity to Great Britain, Lyons <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_198"></a>[V2:pg 198]</span> did not deny
and reported a movement in Congress for ending the reciprocity
treaty with Canada but, on Seward's advice, paid no attention to
this, acknowledging that Seward was very wise in political
manipulation and depending on his opposition to the measure<a name=
"FNanchor1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155">[1155]</a>. Some alarm
was indeed caused through a recurrence by Seward to an idea dating
back to the very beginning of the war of establishing ships off the
Southern ports which should collect duties on imports. He told
Lyons that he had sent a special agent to Adams to explain the
proposal with a view to requesting the approval of Great Britain.
Lyons urged that no such request be made as it was sure to be
refused, interpreting the plan as intended to secure a British
withdrawal of belligerent rights to the South, to be followed by a
bold Northern defiance to France if she objected<a name=
"FNanchor1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156">[1156]</a>. Adams did
discuss the project with Russell but easily agreed to postpone
consideration of it and in this Seward quietly acquiesced<a name=
"FNanchor1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157">[1157]</a>. Apparently
this was less a matured plan than a "feeler," put out to sound
British attitude and to learn, if possible, whether the tie
previously binding England and France in their joint policy toward
America was still strong. Certainly at this same time Seward was
making it plain to Lyons that while opposed to current
Congressional expressions of antagonism to Napoleon's Mexican
policy, he was himself in favour, once the Civil War was ended, of
helping the republican Juarez drive the French from Mexico<a name=
"FNanchor1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158">[1158]</a>.</p>
<p>For nearly three years Russell, like nearly all Englishmen, had
held a firm belief that the South could not be conquered and that
ultimately the North must accept the bitter pill of Southern
independence. Now he began to doubt, yet still held to the theory
that even if conquered the South would never yield peaceful
obedience to the Federal Government. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_199"></a>[V2:pg 199]</span> As a reasoning and reasonable
statesman he wished that the North could be made to see this.</p>
<blockquote>"... It is a pity," he wrote to Lyons, "the Federals
think it worth their while to go on with the war. The obedience
they are ever likely to obtain from the South will not be quiet or
lasting, and they must spend much money and blood to get it. If
they can obtain the right bank of the Mississippi, and New Orleans,
they might as well leave to the Confederates Charleston and
Savannah<a name="FNanchor1159"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1159">[1159]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was but private speculation with no intention of urging it
upon the United States. Yet it indicated a change in the view held
as to the warlike <i>power</i> of the North. Similarly the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, long confident of Southern success and
still prophesying it, was acknowledging that "the unholy [Northern]
dream of universal empire" must first have passed<a name=
"FNanchor1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160">[1160]</a>. Throughout
these spring months of 1864, Lyons continued to dwell upon the now
thoroughly developed readiness of the United States for a foreign
war and urged the sending of a military expert to report on
American preparations<a name="FNanchor1161"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1161">[1161]</a>. He was disturbed by the arrogance
manifested by various members of Lincoln's Cabinet, especially by
Welles, Secretary of the Navy, with whom Seward, so Lyons wrote,
often had difficulty in demonstrating the unfortunate diplomatic
bearing of the acts of naval officers. Seward was as anxious as was
Lyons to avoid irritating incidents, "but he is not as much
listened to as he ought to be by his colleagues in the War and Navy
Departments<a name="FNanchor1162"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1162">[1162]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_200"></a>[V2:pg 200]</span>
<p>Such an act by a naval officer, defiant of British authority and
disregardful of her law, occurred in connection with a matter
already attracting the attention of the British public and causing
some anxiety to Russell--the alleged securing in Ireland of
enlistments for the Northern forces. The war in America had taken
from the ranks of industry in the North great numbers of men and at
the same time had created an increased demand for labour. But the
war had also abruptly checked, in large part, that emigration from
Europe which, since the middle 'forties, had been counted upon as a
regular source of labour supply, easily absorbed in the steady
growth of productive enterprise. A few Northern emissaries of the
Government early sent abroad to revive immigration were soon
reinforced by private labour agents and by the efforts of steamship
companies<a name="FNanchor1163"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1163">[1163]</a>. This resulted in a rapid resumption of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_201"></a>[V2:pg 201]</span>
emigration in 1863, and in several cases groups of Irishmen signed
contracts of such a nature (with non-governmental agents) that on
arrival in America they were virtually black-jacked into the army.
The agents thereby secured large profits from the sums offered
under the bounty system of some of the Eastern states for each
recruit. Lyons soon found himself called upon to protest, on appeal
from a few of these hoodwinked British citizens, and Seward did the
best he could to secure redress, though the process was usually a
long one owing to red-tape and also to the resistance of army
officers.</p>
<p>As soon as the scheme of "bounty profiteers" was discovered
prompt steps were taken to defeat it by the American Secretary of
State. But the few cases occurring, combined with the acknowledged
and encouraged agents of <i>bona fide</i> labour emigration from
Ireland, gave ground for accusations in Parliament that Ireland was
being used against the law as a place of enlistments. Russell had
early taken up the matter with Adams, investigation had followed,
and on it appearing that no authorized Northern agent was engaged
in recruiting in Ireland the subject had been dropped<a name=
"FNanchor1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164">[1164]</a>. There could
be and was no objection to encourage labour emigration, and this
was generally recognized as the basis of the sudden increase of the
numbers going to America<a name="FNanchor1165"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1165">[1165]</a>. But diplomatic and public quiescence
was disturbed when the United States war vessel <i>Kearsarge</i>,
while in port at Queenstown, November, 1863, took on board fifteen
Irishmen and sailed away with them. Russell at once received
indirectly from Mason (who was now in France), charges that these
men had been enlisted and in the presence of the American consul at
Queenstown; he was prompt in investigation but before this was well
under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_202"></a>[V2:pg
202]</span> way the <i>Kearsarge</i> sailed into Queenstown again
and landed the men. She had gone to a French port and no doubt
Adams was quick to give orders for her return. Adams was soon able
to disprove the accusation against the consul but it still remained
a question whether the commander of the vessel was guilty of a bold
defiance of British neutrality. On March 31, 1864, the Irishmen, on
trial at Cork, pleaded guilty to violation of the Foreign
Enlistment Act, but the question of the commander's responsibility
was permitted to drop on Adams' promise, April 11, of further
investigation<a name="FNanchor1166"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1166">[1166]</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Kearsarge</i> case occurred as Parliament was drawing to
a close in 1863, and at a time when Southern efforts were at low
ebb. It was not, therefore, until some months later when a
gentleman with a shady past, named Patrick Phinney, succeeded in
evading British laws and in carrying off to America a group of
Irishmen who found themselves, unwillingly, forced into the
Northern army, that the two cases were made the subject of a
Southern and Tory attack on Russell. The accusations were sharply
made that Russell was not sufficiently active in defending British
law and British honour<a name="FNanchor1167"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1167">[1167]</a>, but these were rather individual
accusations than concerted and do not indicate any idea of making
an issue with the Government<a name="FNanchor1168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1168">[1168]</a>. Whenever opportunity arose some
inquiry up to July, 1864, would be made intended to bring out the
alleged timidity of Russell's policy towards the North--a method
then also being employed on many other matters with the evident
intention <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_203"></a>[V2:pg
203]</span> of weakening the Ministry for the great Tory attack now
being organized on the question of Danish policy.</p>
<p>In truth from the beginning of 1864, America had been pushed to
one side in public and parliamentary interest by the threatening
Danish question which had long been brewing but which did not come
into sharp prominence until March. A year earlier it had become
known that Frederick VII of Denmark, in anticipation of a change
which, under the operations of the Salic law, would come at his
death in the constitutional relations of Denmark to
Schleswig-Holstein, was preparing by a new "constitutional act" to
secure for his successor the retention of these districts. The law
was enacted on November 13, 1863, and Frederick VII died two days
later. His successor, Christian IX, promptly declared his intention
to hold the duchies in spite of their supposed desire to separate
from Denmark and to have their own Prince in the German
Confederation. The Federal Diet of the Confederation had early
protested the purpose of Denmark and Russell had at first upheld
the German arguments but had given no pledges of support to
anyone<a name="FNanchor1169"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1169">[1169]</a>. But Palmerston on various occasions
had gone out of his way to express in Parliament his favour for the
Danish cause and had used incautious language even to the point of
virtually threatening British aid against German ambitions<a name=
"FNanchor1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170">[1170]</a>. A distinct
crisis was thus gradually created, coming to a head when Prussia,
under Bismarck's guiding hand, dragging Austria in with her, thrust
the Federal Diet of the Confederation to one side, and assumed
command of the movement to wrest Schleswig-Holstein from
Denmark.</p>
<p>This occurred in February, 1864, and by this time Palmerston's
utterances, made against the wish of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_204"></a>[V2:pg 204]</span> majority of
his Cabinet colleagues (though this was not known), had so far
aroused the British public as to have created a feeling, widely
voiced, that Great Britain could not sit idly by while Prussia and
Austria worked their will on Denmark. There was excellent ground
for a party attack to unseat the Ministry on the score of a
humiliating "Danish policy," at one time threatening vigorous
British action, then resorting to weak and unsuccessful diplomatic
manoeuvres. For three months the Government laboured to bring about
through a European council some solution that should both save
something for Denmark and save its own prestige. Repeatedly
Palmerston, in the many parliamentary debates on Denmark, broke
loose from his Cabinet colleagues and indulged in threats which
could not fail to give an excellent handle to opponents when once
it became clear that the Ministry had no intention of coming in
arms to the defence of the Danish King.</p>
<p>From February to June, 1864, this issue was to the fore. In its
earlier stages it did not appear to Southern sympathizers to have
any essential bearing on the American question, though they were
soon to believe that in it lay a great hope. Having set the
Southern Independence Association on its feet in London and hoping
much from its planned activities, Lindsay, in March, was
momentarily excited over rumours of some new move by Napoleon.
Being undeceived<a name="FNanchor1171"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1171">[1171]</a> he gave a ready ear to other rumours,
received privately through Delane of the <i>Times</i>, that an
important Southern victory would soon be forthcoming<a name=
"FNanchor1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172">[1172]</a>.
Donoughmore, the herald of this glad news also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Our political prospects here are still very uncertain.
The Conference on the Danish question will either make or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_205"></a>[V2:pg 205]</span>
mar the Government. If they can patch up a peace they will remain
in office. If they fail, out they go<a name=
"FNanchor1173"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1173">[1173]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Here was early expressed the real hope of one faction of extreme
Southern friends in the Danish question. But Lindsay had not yet
made clear where he stood on a possible use of a European situation
to affect the cause of the South. Now, as always, he was the
principal confidant and friend of Mason in England, but he was on
ordinary political questions not in sympathy with Tory principles
or measures. He was soon disgusted with the apathy of the London
Independence Association and threatened to resign membership if
this organization, started with much trumpeting of intended
activity, did not come out boldly in a public demand for the
recognition of the South<a name="FNanchor1174"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1174">[1174]</a>. He had already let it be known that
another motion would be made in Parliament for mediation and
recognition and was indignant that the Association did not at once
declare its adherence. Evidently there were internal difficulties.
Lindsay wrote Mason that he retained membership only to prevent a
break up of the Association and had at last succeeded in securing a
meeting of the Executive Committee when his proposed parliamentary
resolution would be considered. The Manchester Association was much
more alert and ready to support him. "The question is quite ripe
<i>for fresh agitation</i> and from experience I find that that
agitation <i>must</i> be started by a debate in Parliament. No
notice is taken of lectures or speeches in the provinces<a name=
"FNanchor1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175">[1175]</a>."</p>
<p>Before any move was made in Parliament letters to the newspapers
began anew to urge that the Ministry should be pressed to offer
mediation in America. They met with little favourable response. The
<i>Times</i>, at the very end of Lindsay's effort, explained its
indifference, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_206"></a>[V2:pg
206]</span> and recited the situation of October-November, 1862,
stating that the question had then been decided once for all. It
declared that Great Britain had "no moral right to interfere" and
added that to attempt to do so would result in filling "the North
with the same spirit of patriotism and defiance as animated the
invaded Confederates<a name="FNanchor1176"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1176">[1176]</a>." Thus support to Lindsay was lacking
in a hoped-for quarter, but his conferences with Association
members had brought a plan of modified action the essential feature
of which was that the parliamentary motion must not be made a
<i>party</i> one and that the only hope of the South lay in the
existing Government. This was decidedly Lindsay's own view though
it was clearly understood that the opportuneness of the motion lay
in ministerial desire for and need of support in its Danish policy.
Lindsay expected to find Palmerston more complaisant than formerly
as regards American policy and was not disappointed. He wrote to
Mason on May 27:</p>
<blockquote>"I received in due course your note of the 23rd. In a
matter of so much importance I shall make no move in the House in
regard to American affairs without grave consideration. I am
therefore privately consulting the friends of the South. On this
subject we had a meeting of our lifeless association on Monday last
and on the same subject we are to have another meeting next Monday;
but differences of opinion exist there as well as elsewhere, as to
the advisability of moving at present. Some say 'move'--others,
'postpone'--but the news by the <i>Scotia</i> to-morrow will
regulate to a considerable extent our course of action. One thing
is now clear to me that the motion must <i>not</i> be a party one,
and that the main point will be to get the Government to go with
<i>whoever</i> brings forward the motion, for as you are aware I
would rather see the motion in other hands than mine, as my views
on the American question are so well known. As no competent member
however seems disposed to move or rather to incur the
responsibility, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_207"></a>[V2:pg 207]</span> I sent to inquire if it would be
agreeable to Lord Palmerston to see me on American affairs and on
the subject of a motion to be brought forward in the House. He sent
word that he would be very glad to see me, and I had, therefore, a
long meeting with him alone last night, the result of which was
that if I brought forward a motion somewhat as follows, on the
third of June, he would likely be prepared <i>to accept it</i>,
though he asked if I would see him again after the <i>Scotia</i>
arrived. The motion we talked about was to this
<i>effect</i>--'That the House of Commons deeply regretting the
great loss of life and the sufferings of the people of the United
States and the Confederate States of North America by the
continuance of the war which has been so long waged between them,
trust that Her Majesty's Government will avail itself of the
earliest opportunity of mediating in conjunction with the other
powers of Europe to bring about a cessation of
hostilities.'"</blockquote>
<p>Lindsay had suggested to Palmerston that it was desirable for
Mason to return to England and have a conference with the Premier.
To this Palmerston gave a ready consent but, of course, no
invitation. Lindsay strongly urged Mason to come over:</p>
<blockquote><i>I think much good will follow your meeting Lord
Palmerston. It will lead to other meetings</i>; and besides in
other matters I think if you came here, you might <i>at present</i>
prove of much service to the South<a name=
"FNanchor1177"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1177">[1177]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the difference within the Southern Independence
Association permitted the coming forward of a minor London
organization called <i>The Society for Promoting the Cessation of
Hostilities in America</i>. A letter was addressed by it to Members
of Parliament urging that the time had come for action:</p>
<blockquote>"215 <i>Regent Street,<br>
London, W.<br>
May 28th</i>, 1864.<br>
<br>
"SIR,</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Society which has the honour to present to you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_208"></a>[V2:pg 208]</span>
the accompanying pamphlet, begs to state that there now exists in
Great Britain and Ireland a strong desire to see steps taken by the
Government of this country in concert with other Powers, to bring
about peace on a durable basis between the belligerents in North
America.<br>
<br>
"I am directed by the Committee to express a hope that you will,
before the Session closes, support a motion in Parliament to this
effect; and should you desire to see evidence of the feeling of a
large portion of the country in this matter, I shall be most happy
to lay it before you<a name="FNanchor1178"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1178">[1178]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Whether Lindsay, vexed with the delays of the Association, had
stirred the Society to action, is not clear, but the date of this
letter, following on the day after the interview with Palmerston,
is suggestive. The pressure put on Mason to come to London was not
at first successful. Mason had become fixed in the opinion, arrived
at in the previous fall, that there was no favour to be expected
from Palmerston or Russell and that the only hope rested in their
overthrow. Against this idea Lindsay had now taken definite ground.
Moreover, Mason had been instructed to shake the dust of England
from off his shoes with no official authority to return. Carefully
explaining this last point to Lindsay he declined to hold an
interview with Palmerston, except on the latter's invitation, or at
least suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>"Had the suggestion you make of an interview and
conversation with Lord Palmerston originated with his Lordship I
might not have felt myself prohibited by my instructions from at
once acceding to it, but as it has the form only of his assent to a
proposition from you I must with all respect decline it.<br>
<br>
"Although no longer accredited by my Government as Special
Commissioner to Great Britain, I am yet in Europe with full powers,
and therefore, had Lord Palmerston expressed a desire to see me as
his own act (of course unofficially, and even without any reason
assigned for the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_209"></a>[V2:pg 209]</span> interview) I should have had
great pleasure in complying with his request<a name=
"FNanchor1179"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1179">[1179]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The explanation of disinclination to come was lengthy, but the
last paragraph indicated an itching to be active in London again.
Lindsay renewed his urgings and was not only hopeful but elated
over the seeming success of his overtures to the Government. He had
again seen Palmerston and had now pushed his proposal beyond the
timid suggestion of overtures when the opportune moment should
arrive to a definite suggestion of recognition of the
Confederacy:</p>
<blockquote>"I reasoned on the <i>moral</i> effect of recognition,
considering that the restoration of the Union, which was utterly
hopeless, was the object which the North had in view, etc., etc.
This reasoning appeared to produce a considerable effect, for he
appears now to be very open to conviction. He again said that in
his opinion the subjugation of the South could not be effected by
the North, and he added that he thought the people of the North
were becoming more and more alive to the fact every
day."</blockquote>
<p>Lindsay's next step was to be the securing of an interview with
Russell and if he was found to be equally acquiescent all would be
plain sailing:</p>
<blockquote>"Now, if by strong reasoning in a quiet way, and by
stern facts we can get Lord R. to my views, I think I may say that
all difficulty so far as our Cabinet is concerned, <i>is at an
end</i>. I hope to be able to see Lord Russell alone to-morrow. He
used to pay some little attention to any opinions I ventured to
express to him, and I am <i>not</i> without hope. I may add that I
was as frank with Lord Palmerston as he has been pleased to be with
me, and I told him at parting to-day, that my present intention was
not to proceed with the Motion at least for 10 days or a fortnight,
unless he was prepared to support me. He highly commended this
course, and seemed much gratified with what I said. The fact is,
<i>sub rosa</i>, it is clear to me that <i>no</i> motion will be
carried unless <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_210"></a>[V2:pg
210]</span> it is supported by the Government for it is clear that
Lord Derby is resolved to leave the responsibility with the
Executive, and therefore, <i>in the present state of matters</i>,
it would seriously injure the cause of the South to bring forward
any motion which would not be carried."</blockquote>
<p>Lindsay then urges Mason to come at once to London.</p>
<blockquote>"Now apart altogether from you seeing Lord Palmerston,
I must earnestly entreat you to come here. Unless you are much
wanted in Paris, your visit here, as a private gentleman, can do no
harm, and <i>may, at the present moment, be of great service to
your country</i><a name="FNanchor1180"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1180">[1180]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Palmerston's willingness to listen to suggestions of what would
have amounted to a complete face-about of British policy on
America, his "gratification" that Lindsay intended to postpone the
parliamentary motion, his friendly courtesy to a man whom he had
but recently rebuked for a meddlesome "amateur diplomacy," can be
interpreted in no other light than an evidence of a desire to
prevent Southern friends from joining in the attack, daily becoming
more dangerous, on the Government's Danish policy. How much of this
Lindsay understood is not clear; on the face of his letters to
Mason he would seem to have been hoodwinked, but the more
reasonable supposition is, perhaps, that much was hoped from the
governmental necessity of not alienating supporters. The Danish
situation was to be used, but without an open threat. In addition
the tone of the public press, for some time gloomy over Southern
prospects, was now restored to the point of confidence and in this
the <i>Times</i> was again leading<a name=
"FNanchor1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181">[1181]</a>. The Society
for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in America quickly
issued another circular letter inviting Members of Parliament to
join in a deputation to call on Palmerston to urge action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_211"></a>[V2:pg 211]</span> on
the lines of Lindsay's first overture. Such a deputation would
represent "more than 5,000 members and the feeling of probably more
than twenty millions of people." It should not be a deputation "of
parties" but representative of all groups in Parliament:</p>
<blockquote>"The Society has reason to believe that the Premier is
disposed to look favourably upon the attempt here contemplated and
that the weight of an influential deputation would strengthen his
hands<a name="FNanchor1182"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1182">[1182]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This proposal from the Society was now lagging behind Lindsay's
later objective--namely, direct recognition. That this was felt to
be unfortunate is shown by a letter from Tremlett, Honorary
Secretary of the Society, to Mason. He wrote that the <i>Southern
Independence Association</i>, finally stirred by Lindsay's
insistence, had agreed to join the Society in a representation to
Palmerston but had favoured some specific statement on recognition.
Palmerston had sent word that he favoured the Society's resolution
but not that of the Association, and as a result the joint letter
of the two organizations would be on the mild lines of Lindsay's
original motion:</p>
<blockquote>"Although this quite expresses the object of our
Society, still I do not think the 'Independence Association' ought
to have 'ratted' from its principles. It ought not to have
consented to ignore the question which it was instituted to bring
before Parliament--that of the Independence of the Confederacy--and
more than that, the ambiguous ending of the resolution to be
submitted is not such as I think ought to be allowed. You know the
resolution and therefore I need only quote the obnoxious words
'That Her Majesty's Government will avail itself of the earliest
opportunity of mediating, etc.'<br>
<br>
"This is just leaving the Government where they have been all
along. They have always professed to take 'the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_212"></a>[V2:pg 212]</span> earliest
opportunity' but of which they are to be the judges<a name=
"FNanchor1183"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1183">[1183]</a>!"</blockquote>
<p>Evidently there was confusion in the ranks and disagreement
among the leaders of Southern friends. Adams, always cool in
judgment of where lay the wind, wrote to Seward on this same day
that Lindsay was delaying his motion until the receipt of
favourable news upon which to spring it. Even such news, Adams
believed, would not alter British policy unless it should depict
the "complete defeat and dispersion" of Northern forces<a name=
"FNanchor1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184">[1184]</a>. The day
following the <i>Times</i> reported Grant to be meeting fearful
reverses in Virginia and professed to regard Sherman's easy advance
toward Atlanta as but a trap set for the Northern army in the
West<a name="FNanchor1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185">[1185]</a>.
But in reality the gage of battle for Southern advantage in England
was fixed upon a European, not an American, field. Mason understood
this perfectly. He had yielded to Lindsay's insistence and had come
to London. There he listened to Lindsay's account of the interview
(now held) with Russell, and June 8 reported it to Slidell:</p>
<blockquote>"Of his intercourse with Lord Russell he reports in
substance that his Lordship was unusually gracious and seemed well
disposed to go into conversation. Lord Russell agreed that the war
on the part of the United States was hopeless and that neither
could union be restored nor the South brought under the yoke.... In
regard to Lindsay's motion Lord Russell said, that he could not
<i>accept</i> it, but if brought up for discussion his side would
<i>speak</i> favourably of it. That is to say they would commend it
if they could not vote for it."</blockquote>
<p>This referred to Lindsay's original motion of using the
"earliest opportunity of mediation," and the pleasant <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_213"></a>[V2:pg 213]</span> reception
given by Russell scarcely justified any great hope of decided
benefit for the South. It must now have been fairly apparent to
Lindsay, as it certainly was to Mason, that all this complaisance
by Palmerston and Russell was but political manipulation to retain
or to secure support in the coming contest with the Tories. The two
old statesmen, wise in parliamentary management, were angling for
every doubtful vote. Discussing with Lindsay the prospects for
governmental action Mason now ventured to suggest that perhaps the
best chances of success lay with the Tories, and found him
unexpectedly in agreement:</p>
<blockquote>"I told Lindsay (but for his ear only) that Mr. Hunter,
editor of the <i>Herald</i>, had written to Hotze about his
connection with Disraeli, and he said at once, that if the latter
took it up in earnest, it could not be in better hands and would
carry at the expense of the Ministry and that he would most
cheerfully and eagerly yield him the <i>pas</i>. Disraeli's
accession, as you remember, was contingent upon our success in
Virginia--and agreeing entirely with Lindsay that the movement
could not be in better hands and as there were but 10 days before
his motion could again come, I thought the better policy would be
for the present that he should be silent and to await
events<a name="FNanchor1186"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1186">[1186]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Slidell was less sceptical than was Mason but agreed that it
might best advantage the South to be rid of Russell:</p>
<blockquote>"If Russell can be trusted, which to me is very
doubtful, Lindsay's motion must succeed. Query, how would its being
brought forward by Disraeli affect Russell's action--if he can be
beaten on a fair issue it would be better for us perhaps than if it
appeared to be carried with his qualified assent<a name=
"FNanchor1187"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1187">[1187]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But Mason understood that Southern expectation of a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_214"></a>[V2:pg 214]</span> change in
British policy toward America must rest (and even then but
doubtfully) on a change of Government. By June 29 his personal
belief was that the Tory attack on the Danish question would be
defeated and that this would "of course postpone Lindsay's
projected motion<a name="FNanchor1188"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1188">[1188]</a>." On June 25, the Danish Conference had
ended and the Prussian war with Denmark was renewed. There was a
general feeling of shame over Palmerston's bluster followed by a
meek British inaction. The debate came on a vote of censure, July
8, in the course of which Derby characterized governmental policy
as one of "meddle and muddle." The censure was carried in the Lords
by nine votes, but was defeated in the Commons by a ministerial
majority of eighteen. It was the sharpest political crisis of
Palmerston's Ministry during the Civil War. Every supporting vote
was needed<a name="FNanchor1189"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1189">[1189]</a>.</p>
<p>Not only had Lindsay's motion been postponed but the interview
with Palmerston for which Mason had come to London had also been
deferred in view of the parliamentary crisis. When finally held on
July 14, it resolved itself into a proud and emphatic assertion by
Mason that the South could not be conquered, that the North was
nearly ready to acknowledge it and that the certainty of Lincoln's
defeat in the coming Presidential election was proof of this.
Palmerston appears to have said little.</p>
<blockquote>"At the conclusion I said to him in reply to his
remark, that he was gratified in making my acquaintance, that I
felt obliged by his invitation to the interview, but that the
obligation would be increased if I could take with me any
expectation that the Government of Her Majesty was prepared to
unite with France, in some act expressive of their sense that the
war should come to an end. He said, that perhaps, as I was of
opinion that the crisis was at hand, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_215"></a>[V2:pg 215]</span> it might be better to wait until
it had arrived. I told him that my opinion was that the crisis had
passed, at least so far as that the war of invasion would end with
the campaign<a name="FNanchor1190"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1190">[1190]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Reporting the interview to Slidell in much the same language,
Mason wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"My own impressions derived from the whole interview
are, that [while] P. is as well satisfied as I am, that the
separation of the States is final and the independence of the South
an accomplished fact, the Ministry fears to move under the menaces
of the North<a name="FNanchor1191"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1191">[1191]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Slidell's comment was bitter:</p>
<blockquote>"I am very much obliged for your account of your
interview with Lord Palmerston. It resulted very much as I had
anticipated excepting that his Lordship appears to have said even
less than I had supposed he would. However, the time has now
arrived when it is comparatively of very little importance what
Queen or Emperor may say or think about us. A plague, I say, on
both your Houses<a name="FNanchor1192"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1192">[1192]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Slidell's opinion from this time on was, indeed, that the South
had nothing to expect from Europe until the North itself should
acknowledge the independence of the Confederacy. July 21, <i>The
Index</i> expressed much the same view and was equally bitter. It
quoted an item in the <i>Morning Herald</i> of July 16, to the
effect that Mason had secured an interview with Palmerston and that
"the meeting was satisfactory to all parties":</p>
<blockquote>"The withdrawal of Mr. Lindsay's motion was, it is
said, the result of that interview, the Premier having given a sort
of implied promise to support it at a more opportune moment; that
is to say, when Grant and Sherman have <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_216"></a>[V2:pg 216]</span> been defeated,
and the Confederacy stand in no need of recognition."</blockquote>
<p>In the same issue <i>The Index</i> described a deputation of
clergymen, noblemen, Members of Parliament "and other distinguished
and influential gentlemen" who had waited upon Palmerston to urge
mediation toward a cessation of hostilities in America. Thus at
last the joint project of the Southern Independence Association and
of the Society for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in
America had been put in execution <i>after</i> the political storm
had passed and not before--when the deputation might have had some
influence. But the fact was that no deputation, unless a purely
party one, could have been collected before the conclusion of the
Danish crisis. When finally assembled it "had no party complexion,"
and the smiling readiness with which it received Palmerston's
jocular reply indicating that Britain's safest policy was to keep
strictly to neutrality is evidence that even the deputation itself
though harassed by Lindsay and others into making this
demonstration, was quite content to let well enough alone. Not so
<i>The Index</i> which sneered at the childishness of
Palmerston:</p>
<blockquote>"... He proved incontestably to his visitors that,
though he has been charged with forgetting the vigour of his prime,
he can in old age remember the lessons of his childhood, by telling
them that<br>
<br>
<blockquote>They who in quarrels interpose<br>
Will often wipe a bloody nose (laughter)--</blockquote>
<br>
a quotation which, in the mouth of the Prime Minister of the
British Empire, and on such an occasion, must be admitted as not
altogether unworthy of Abraham Lincoln himself<a name=
"FNanchor1193"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1193">[1193]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Spence took consolation in the fact that Mason had at last come
into personal contact with Palmerston, "even <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_217"></a>[V2:pg 217]</span> now at his
great age a charming contrast to that piece of small human
pipe-clay, Lord Russell<a name="FNanchor1194"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1194">[1194]</a>." But the whole incident of Lindsay's
excited efforts, Mason's journey to London and interview with
Palmerston, and the deputation, left a bad taste in the mouth of
the more determined friends of the South--of those who were
Confederates rather than Englishmen. They felt that they had been
deceived and toyed with by the Government. Mason's return to London
was formally approved at Richmond but Benjamin wrote that the
argument for recognition advanced to Palmerston had laid too much
stress on the break-down of the North. All that was wanted was
recognition which was due the South from the mere facts of the
existing situation, and recognition, if accorded, would have at
once ended the war without intervention in any form<a name=
"FNanchor1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195">[1195]</a>. Similarly
<i>The Index</i> stated that mediation was an English notion, not a
Southern one. The South merely desired justice, that is,
recognition<a name="FNanchor1196"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1196">[1196]</a>. This was a bold front yet one not
unwarranted by the military situation in midsummer of 1864, as
reported in the press. Sherman's western campaign toward Atlanta
had but just started and little was known of the strength of his
army or of the powers of Southern resistance. This campaign was
therefore regarded as of minor importance. It was on Grant's
advance toward Richmond that British attention was fixed; Lee's
stiff resistance, the great losses of the North in battle after
battle and finally the settling down by Grant to besiege the
Southern lines at Petersburg, in late June, 1864, seemed to
indicate that once again an offensive in Virginia to "end the war"
was doomed to that failure which had marked the similar efforts of
each of the three preceding years.</p>
<p>Southern efforts in England to alter British neutrality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_218"></a>[V2:pg 218]</span>
practically ended with Lindsay's proposed but undebated motion of
June, 1864, but British confidence in Southern ability to defend
herself indefinitely, a confidence somewhat shattered at the
beginning of 1864--had renewed its strength by July. For the next
six months this was to be the note harped upon in society, by
organizations, and in the friendly press.</p>

174. An amusing reply from an "historian" inclined to dodge is
printed as of importance. One would like to know his identity, and
what his "judicial situation" was. "An eminent Conservative
historian writes as follows: 'I hesitate to become a member of your
Association from a doubt whether I should take that open step to
which my inclinations strongly prompt me, or adhere to the
neutrality in public life to which, as holding a high and
responsible judicial situation in this country, I have hitherto
invariably confined myself. And after mature consideration I am of
opinion that it will be more decorous to abide in this instance by
my former rule. I am the more inclined to follow this course from
the reflection that by not appearing in public as an advocate of
the Southern States, I shall be able to serve their cause more
effectually in my literary character. And the printing of a new
edition of my 'History' (which is now going on) will afford me
several opportunities of doing so, of which I shall not fail gladly
to avail myself.'"</blockquote>

gentry, it founds families, it favours leisure and field sports; it
develops a special class of thoughtful, responsible, guiding, and
protecting minds; it tends to elevation of sentiment and refinement
of manners" (p. 61). Especially he insisted the South was intensely
religious and he finally dismissed slavery with the phrase: "The

removal of one social evil" (p. 175).</blockquote>

cause for anxiety. "In six months at the furthest, this unhappy
rebellion will be brought to a close. We shall then have an account
to settle with the Governments that have either outraged us by a
recognition of what they call 'the belligerent rights' of the
rebels, or by the active sympathy and aid which they have afforded
them. Let France and England beware how they swell up this
catalogue of wrongs. By the time specified we shall have unemployed
a veteran army of close upon a million of the finest troops in the
world, with whom we shall be in a position not only to drive the
French out of Mexico and to annex Canada, but, by the aid of our
powerful navy, even to return the compliment of intervention in
European affairs." (Quoted by <i>The Index</i>, July 23, 1863, p.
203.)</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1163"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor1163">[1163]</a> Bigelow, <i>Retrospections</i>, I, p.
563, states that great efforts were made by the Government to
stimulate immigration both to secure a labour supply and to fill up
the armies. Throughout and even since the war the charge has been
made by the South that the foreign element, after 1862,
preponderated in Northern armies. There is no way of determining
the exact facts in regard to this for no statistics were kept. A
Memorandum prepared by the U.S. War Department, dated July 15,
1898, states that of the men examined for physical fitness by the
several boards of enrolment, subsequent to September 1, 1864 (at
which time, if ever, the foreign element should have shown
preponderance), the figures of nativity stood: United States,
341,569; Germany, 54,944; Ireland, 50,537; British-America, 21,645;
England, 16,196; and various other countries no one of which
reached the 3,500 mark. These statistics really mean little as
regards war-time immigration since they do not show <i>when</i> the
foreign-born came to America; further, from the very first days of
the war there had been a large element of American citizens of
German and Irish birth in the Northern armies. Moreover, the
British statistics of emigration, examined in relation to the
figures given above, negative the Southern accusation. In 1861, but
38,000 subjects of Great Britain emigrated to the United States; in
1862, 48,000; while in 1863 the number suddenly swelled to 130,000,
and this figure was repeated in 1864. In each year almost exactly
two-thirds were from Ireland. Now of the 94,000 from Ireland in
1863, considering the number of Irish-American citizens already in
the army, it is evident that the bulk must have gone into labour
supply.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>BRITISH CONFIDENCE IN THE SOUTH</h3>
<br>
<p>After three years of great Northern efforts to subdue the South
and of Southern campaigns aimed, first, merely toward resistance,
but later involving offensive battles, the Civil War, to European
eyes, had reached a stalemate where neither side could conquer the
other. To the European neutral the situation was much as in the
Great War it appeared to the American neutral in December, 1916, at
the end of two years of fighting. In both wars the neutral had
expected and had prophesied a short conflict. In both, this had
proved to be false prophecy and with each additional month of the
Civil War there was witnessed an increase of the forces employed
and a psychological change in the people whereby war seemed to have
become a normal state of society. The American Civil War, as
regards continuity, numbers of men steadily engaged, resources
employed, and persistence of the combatants, was the "Great War,"
to date, of all modern conflicts. Not only British, but nearly all
foreign observers were of the opinion by midsummer of 1864, after
an apparent check to Grant in his campaign toward Richmond, that
all America had become engaged in a struggle from which there was
scant hope of emergence by a decisive military victory. There was
little knowledge of the steady decline of the resources of the
South even though Jefferson Davis in a message to the Confederate
Congress in February, 1864, had spoken bitterly of Southern
disorganization<a name="FNanchor1197"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1197">[1197]</a>. Yet this belief in stalemate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_220"></a>[V2:pg 220]</span> in
essence still postulated an ultimate Southern victory, for the
function of the Confederacy was, after all, to <i>resist</i> until
its independence was recognized. Ardent friends of the North in
England both felt and expressed confidence in the outcome, but the
general attitude of neutral England leaned rather to faith in the
powers of indefinite Southern resistance, so loudly voiced by
Southern champions.</p>
<p>There was now one element in the situation, however, that
hampered these Southern champions. The North was at last fully
identified with the cause of emancipation; the South with the
perpetuation of slavery. By 1864, it was felt to be impossible to
remain silent on this subject and even in the original constitution
and address of the Southern Independence Association a clause was
adopted expressing a hope for the gradual extinction of
slavery<a name="FNanchor1198"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1198">[1198]</a>. This brought Mason some heartburnings
and he wrote to Spence in protest, the latter's reply being that he
also agreed that the South ought not to be offered gratuitous
advice on what was purely "an internal question," but that the
topic was full of difficulties and the clause would have to stand,
at least in some modified form. At Southern public meetings, also,
there arose a tendency to insert in resolutions similar
expressions. "In Manchester," Spence wrote, "Mr. Lees, J.P., and
the strongest man on the board, brought forward a motion for an
address on this subject. I went up to Manchester purposely to quash
it and I did so effectually<a name="FNanchor1199"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1199">[1199]</a>."</p>
<p>Northern friends were quick to strike at this weakness in
Southern armour; they repeatedly used a phrase, "The Foul Blot,"
and by mere iteration gave such currency to it that even in
Southern meetings it was repeated. <i>The Index</i>, as early as
February, 1864, felt compelled to meet the phrase and in an
editorial, headed "The Foul Blot," <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_221"></a>[V2:pg 221]</span> argued the error of Southern
friends. As long as they could use the word "blot" in
characterization of Southern slavery, <i>The Index</i> felt that
there could be no effective British push for Southern independence
and it asserted that slavery, in the sense in which England
understood it, did not exist in the Confederacy.</p>
<blockquote>"... It is truly horrible to reduce human beings to the
condition of cattle, to breed them, to sell them, and otherwise
dispose of them, as cattle. But is it defending such practices to
say that the South does none of these things, but that on the
contrary, both in theory and in practice, she treats the negro as a
fellow-creature, with a soul to be saved, with feelings to be
respected, though in the social order in a subordinate place, and
of an intellectual organization which requires guardianship with
mutual duties and obligations? This system is called slavery,
because it developed itself out of an older and very different one
of that name, but for this the South is not to blame.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"But of this the friends of the South may be assured, that so long
as they make no determined effort to relieve the Southern character
from this false drapery, they will never gain for it that respect,
that confidence in the rectitude of Southern motives, that active
sympathy, which can alone evoke effective assistance.... The best
assurance you can give that the destinies of the negro race are
safe in Southern hands is, not that the South will repent and
reform, but that she has consistently and conscientiously been the
friend and benefactor of that race.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"It is, therefore, always with pain that we hear such expressions
as 'the foul blot,' and similar ones, fall from the lips of earnest
promoters of Confederate Independence. As a concession they are
useless; as a confession they are untrue.... Thus the Southerner
may retort as we have seen that an Englishman would retort for his
country. He might say the South is proud, and of nothing more proud
than this--not that she has slaves, but that she has treated them
as slaves never were treated before, that she has used power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_222"></a>[V2:pg 222]</span> as
no nation ever used it under similar circumstances, and that she
has solved mercifully and humanely a most difficult problem which
has elsewhere defied solution save in blood. Or he might use the
unspoken reflection of an honest Southerner at hearing much said of
'the foul blot': 'It was indeed a dark and damnable blot that
England left us with, and it required all the efforts of Southern
Christianity to pale it as it now is<a name=
"FNanchor1200"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1200">[1200]</a>.'"</blockquote>
<p>In 1862 and to the fall of 1863, <i>The Index</i> had declared
that slavery was not an issue in the war; now its defence of the
"domestic institution" of the South, repeatedly made in varying
forms, was evidence of the great effect in England of Lincoln's
emancipation edicts. <i>The Index</i> could not keep away from the
subject. In March, quotations were given from the <i>Reader</i>,
with adverse comments, upon a report of a controversy aroused in
scientific circles by a paper read before the Anthropological
Society of London. James Hunt was the author and the paper,
entitled "The Negro's Place in Nature," aroused the contempt of
Huxley who criticized it at the meeting as unscientific and placed
upon it the "stigma of public condemnation." The result was a fine
controversy among the scientists which could only serve to
emphasize the belief that slavery was indeed an issue in the
American War and that the South was on the defensive. Winding up a
newspaper duel with Hunt who emerged rather badly mauled, Huxley
asserted "the North is justified in any expenditure of blood or
treasure which shall eradicate a system hopelessly inconsistent
with the moral elevation, the political freedom, or the economical
progress of the American people<a name="FNanchor1201"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1201">[1201]</a>...."</p>
<p>Embarrassment caused by the "Foul Blot" issue, the impossibility
to many sincere Southern friends of accepting the view-point of
<i>The Index</i>, acted as a check upon the holding of public
meetings and prevented the carrying out of that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_223"></a>[V2:pg 223]</span> intensive
public campaign launched by Spence and intended to be fostered by
the Southern Independence Association. By the end of June, 1864,
there was almost a complete cessation of Southern meetings, not
thereafter renewed, except spasmodically for a brief period in the
fall just before the Presidential election in America<a name=
"FNanchor1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202">[1202]</a>. Northern
meetings were continuous throughout the whole period of the war but
were less frequent in 1864 than in 1863. They were almost entirely
of two types--those held by anti-slavery societies and religious
bodies and those organized for, or by, working men. An analysis of
those recorded in the files of <i>The Liberator</i>, and in the
reports sent by Adams to Seward permits the following

<br>
<p>Many persons took part in these meetings as presiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_224"></a>[V2:pg 224]</span>
officers or as speakers and movers of resolutions; among them those
appearing with frequency were George Thompson, Rev. Dr. Cheever,
Rev. Newman Hall, John Bright, Professor Newman, Mr. Bagley, M.P.,
Rev. Francis Bishop, P.A. Taylor, M.P., William Evans, Thomas
Bayley Potter, F.W. Chesson and Mason Jones. While held in all
parts of England and Scotland the great majority of meetings were
held in London and in the manufacturing districts with Manchester
as a centre. From the first the old anti-slavery orator of the
'thirties, George Thompson, had been the most active speaker and
was credited by all with having given new life to the moribund
emancipation sentiment of Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204">[1204]</a>. Thompson
asserted that by the end of 1863 there was a "vigilant, active and
energetic" anti-slavery society in almost every great town or
city<a name="FNanchor1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205">[1205]</a>.
Among the working-men, John Bright was without question the most
popular advocate of the Northern cause, but there were many others,
not named in the preceding list, constantly active and
effective<a name="FNanchor1206"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1206">[1206]</a>. Forster, in the judgment of many, was
the most influential friend of the North in Parliament, but Bright,
also an influence in Parliament, rendered his chief service in
moulding the opinion of Lancashire and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_225"></a>[V2:pg 225]</span> became to
American eyes their great English champion, a view attested by the
extraordinary act of President Lincoln in pardoning, on the appeal
of Bright, and in his honour, a young Englishman named Alfred
Rubery, who had become involved in a plot to send out from the port
of San Francisco, a Confederate "privateer" to prey on Northern
commerce<a name="FNanchor1207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1207">[1207]</a>.</p>
<p>This record of the activities of Northern friends and
organizations, the relative subsidence of their efforts in the
latter part of 1864, thus indicating their confidence in Northern
victory, the practical cessation of public Southern meetings, are
nevertheless no proof that the bulk of English opinion had greatly
wavered in its faith in Southern powers of resistance. The
Government, it is true, was better informed and was exceedingly
anxious to tread gently in relations with the North, the more so as
there was now being voiced by the public in America a sentiment of
extreme friendship for Russia as the "true friend" in opposition to
the "unfriendly neutrality" of Great Britain and France<a name=
"FNanchor1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208">[1208]</a>. It was a
period of many minor irritations, arising out of the blockade,
inflicted by America on British interests, but to these Russell
paid little attention except to enter formal protests. He wrote to
Lyons:</p>
<blockquote>"I do not want to pick a quarrel out of our many just
causes of complaint. But it will be as well that Lincoln and Seward
should see that we are long patient, and do <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_226"></a>[V2:pg 226]</span> nothing to
distract their attention from the arduous task they have so
wantonly undertaken<a name="FNanchor1209"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1209">[1209]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lyons was equally desirous of avoiding frictions. In August he
thought that the current of political opinion was running against
the re-election of Lincoln, noting that the Northern papers were
full of expressions favouring an armistice, but pointed out that
neither the "peace party" nor the advocates of an armistice ever
talked of any solution of the war save on the basis of re-union.
Hence Lyons strongly advised that "the quieter England and France
were just at this moment the better<a name=
"FNanchor1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210">[1210]</a>." Even the
suggested armistice was not thought of, he stated, as extending to
a relaxation of the blockade. Of military probabilities, Lyons
professed himself to be no judge, but throughout all his letters
there now ran, as for some time previously, a note of warning as to
the great power and high determination of the North.</p>
<p>But if the British Government was now quietly operating upon the
theory of an ultimate Northern victory, or at least with the view
that the only hope for the South lay in a Northern weariness of
war, the leading British newspapers were still indulging in
expressions of confidence in the South while at the same time
putting much faith in the expected defeat of Lincoln at the polls.
As always at this period, save for the few newspapers avowedly
friendly to the North and one important daily professing strict
neutrality--the <i>Telegraph</i>--the bulk of the metropolitan
press took its cue, as well as much of its war news, from the
columns of the <i>Times</i>. This journal, while early assuming a
position of belief in Southern success, had yet given both sides in
the war fair accuracy in its reports--those of the New York
correspondent, Mackay, always excepted. But from June, 1864, a
change came over the <i>Times</i>; it was either itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_227"></a>[V2:pg 227]</span>
deceived or was wilfully deceiving its readers, for steadily every
event for the rest of the year was coloured to create an impression
of the unlimited powers of Southern resistance. Read to-day in the
light of modern knowledge of the military situation throughout the
war, the <i>Times</i> gave accurate reports for the earlier years
but became almost hysterical; not to say absurd, for the last year
of the conflict. Early in June, 1864, Grant was depicted as meeting
reverses in Virginia and as definitely checked, while Sherman in
the West was being drawn into a trap in his march toward
Atlanta<a name="FNanchor1211"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1211">[1211]</a>. The same ideas were repeated
throughout July. Meanwhile there had begun to be printed a series
of letters from a Southern correspondent at Richmond who wrote in
contempt of Grant's army.</p>
<blockquote>"I am at a loss to convey to you the contemptuous tone
in which the tried and war-worn soldiers of General Lee talk of the
huddled rabble of black, white, and copper-coloured victims (there
are Indians serving under the Stars and Stripes) who are at times
goaded up to the Southern lines.... The truth is that for the first
time in modern warfare we are contemplating an army which is at
once republican and undisciplined<a name=
"FNanchor1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212">[1212]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>At the moment when such effusions could find a place in London's
leading paper the facts of the situation were that the South was
unable to prevent almost daily desertions and was wholly unable to
spare soldiers to recover and punish the deserters. But on this the
<i>Times</i> was either ignorant or wilfully silent. It was indeed
a general British sentiment during the summer of 1864, that the
North was losing its power and determination in the war<a name=
"FNanchor1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213">[1213]</a>, even though
it was unquestioned that the earlier "enthusiasm for the
slave-holders" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_228"></a>[V2:pg
228]</span> had passed away<a name="FNanchor1214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1214">[1214]</a>. One element in the influence of the
<i>Times</i> was its <i>seeming</i> impartiality accompanied by a
pretentious assertion of superior information and wisdom that at
times irritated its contemporaries, but was recognized as making
this journal the most powerful agent in England. Angry at a
<i>Times</i> editorial in February, 1863, in which Mason had been
berated for a speech made at the Lord Mayor's banquet, <i>The
Index</i> declared:</p>
<blockquote>"Our contemporary is all things to all men. It not only
shouts with the largest crowd, according to the Pickwickian
philosophy, but with a skill and daring that command admiration, it
shouts simultaneously with opposite and contending crowds. It is
everybody's <i>Times</i><a name="FNanchor1215"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1215">[1215]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Yet <i>The Index</i> knew, and frequently so stated, that the
<i>Times</i> was at bottom pro-Southern. John Bright's medium, the
<i>Morning Star</i>, said: "There was something bordering on the
sublime in the tremendous audacity of the war news supplied by the
<i>Times</i>. Of course, its prophecies were in a similar style.
None of your doubtful oracles there; none of your double-meaning
vaticinations, like that which took poor Pyrrhus in<a name=
"FNanchor1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216">[1216]</a>." In short,
the <i>Times</i> became for the last year of the war the Bible of
their faith to Southern sympathizers, and was frequent in its
preachments<a name="FNanchor1217"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1217">[1217]</a>.</p>
<p>There was one journal in London which claimed to have equal if
not greater knowledge and authority in military matters. This was
the weekly <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i>, and its editor, W.H.
Russell, in 1861 war correspondent in America of the <i>Times</i>,
but recalled shortly after his famous letter on the battle of Bull
Run, consistently maintained after the war had ended that he had
always asserted <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_229"></a>[V2:pg 229]</span> the ultimate victory of the
North and was, indeed, so pro-Northern in sentiment that this was
the real cause of his recall<a name="FNanchor1218"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1218">[1218]</a>. He even claimed to have believed in
Northern victory to the extent of re-union. These protestations
after the event are not borne out by the columns of the
<i>Gazette</i>, for that journal was not far behind the
<i>Times</i> in its delineation of incidents unfavourable to the
North and in its all-wise prophecies of Northern disaster. The
<i>Gazette</i> had no wide circulation except among those in the
service, but its <i>dicta</i>, owing to the established reputation
of Russell and to the specialist nature of the paper, were
naturally quite readily accepted and repeated in the ordinary
press. Based on a correct appreciation of man power and resources
the <i>Gazette</i> did from time to time proclaim its faith in
Northern victory<a name="FNanchor1219"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1219">[1219]</a>, but always in such terms as to render
possible a hedge on expressed opinion and always with the assertion
that victory would not result in reunion. Russell's most definite
prophecy was made on July 30, 1864:</p>
<blockquote>"The Southern Confederacy, like Denmark, is left to
fight by itself, without even a conference or an armistice to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_230"></a>[V2:pg 230]</span>
aid it; and it will be strange indeed if the heroism, endurance,
and resources of its soldiers and citizens be not eventually
dominated by the perseverance and superior means of the Northern
States. Let us repeat our profession of faith in the matter. We
hold that the Union perished long ago, and that its component parts
can never again be welded into a Confederacy of self-governing
States, with a common executive, army, fleet, and central
government. Not only that. The principle of Union itself among the
non-seceding States is so shocked and shattered by the war which
has arisen, that the fissures in it are likely to widen and spread,
and to form eventually great gulfs separating the Northern Union
itself into smaller bodies. But ere the North be convinced of the
futility of its efforts to substitute the action of force for that
of free will, we think it will reduce the Southern States to the
direst misery<a name="FNanchor1220"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1220">[1220]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>Such occasional "professions of faith," accompanied by sneers at
the "Confederate partisanship" of the <i>Times</i><a name=
"FNanchor1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221">[1221]</a> served to
differentiate the <i>Gazette</i> from other journals, but when it
came to description and estimate of specific campaigns there was
little to choose between them and consequently little variance in
the effect upon the public. Thus a fortnight before his "profession
of faith," Russell could comment editorially on Sherman's campaign
toward Atlanta:</p>
<blockquote>"The next great Federal army on which the hopes of the
North have so long been fixed promises to become a source of
fearful anxiety. Sherman, if not retreating, is certainly not
advancing; and, if the Confederates can interfere seriously with
his communications, he must fall back as soon as he has eaten up
all the supplies of the district.... All the enormous advantages
possessed by the Federals have been nullified by want of skill, by
the interference of Washington civilians, and by the absence of an
animating homogeneous spirit on the part of their soldiery<a name=
"FNanchor1222"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1222">[1222]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_231"></a>[V2:pg 231]</span>
<p>Hand in hand with war news adverse to the North went comments on
the Presidential election campaign in America, with prophecies of
Lincoln's defeat. This was indeed but a reflection of the American
press but the citations made in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_232"></a>[V2:pg 232]</span> British papers emphasized
especially Northern weariness of Lincoln's despotism and
inefficiency. Thus, first printed in <i>The Index</i>, an extract
from a New York paper, <i>The New Nation</i>, got frequent
quotation:</p>
<blockquote>"We have been imposed upon long enough. The ruin which
you have been unable to accomplish in four years, would certainly
be fully consummated were you to remain in power four years longer.
Your military governors and their provost-marshals override the
laws, and the <i>echo of the armed heel rings forth as dearly now
in America as in France or Austria. You have encroached upon our
liberty without securing victory, and we must have both</i><a name=
"FNanchor1223"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1223">[1223]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>It was clearly understood that Northern military efforts would
have an important bearing on the election. The <i>Times</i> while
expressing admiration for Sherman's boldness in the Atlanta
campaign was confident of his defeat:</p>
<blockquote>"... it is difficult to see how General Sherman can
escape a still more disastrous fate than that which threatened his
predecessor. He has advanced nearly one hundred and fifty miles
from his base of operations, over a mountainous country; and he has
no option but to retreat by the same line as he advanced. This is
the first instance of a Federal general having ventured far from
water communications. That Sherman has hitherto done so with
success is a proof of both courage and ability, but he will need
both these qualities in a far greater degree if he is forced to
retreat<a name="FNanchor1224"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1224">[1224]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>And W.H. Russell, in the <i>Gazette</i>, included Grant in the
approaching disaster:</p>
<blockquote>"The world has never seen anything in war so slow and
fatuous as Grant's recent movements, except it be those of Sherman.
Each is wriggling about like a snake in the presence of an
ichneumon. They both work round and round, now on one flank and
then on the other, and on each move meet the unwinking eye of the
enemy, ready for his spring and bite. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_233"></a>[V2:pg 233]</span> In sheer
despair Grant and Sherman must do something at last. As to
shelling! Will they learn from history? Then they will know that
they cannot shell an army provided with as powerful artillery as
their own out of a position.... The Northerners have, indeed, lost
the day solely owing to the want of average ability in their
leaders in the field<a name="FNanchor1225"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1225">[1225]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On the very day when Russell thus wrote in the <i>Gazette</i>
the city of Atlanta had been taken by Sherman. When the news
reached England the <i>Times</i> having declared this impossible,
now asserted that it was unimportant, believed that Sherman could
not remain in possession and, two days later, turned with vehemence
to an analysis of the political struggle as of more vital
influence. The Democrats, it was insisted, would place peace
"paramount to union" and were sure to win<a name=
"FNanchor1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226">[1226]</a>. Russell, in
the <i>Gazette</i>, coolly ignoring its prophecy of three weeks
earlier, now spoke as if he had always foreseen the fall of
Atlanta:</p>
<blockquote>"General Sherman has fully justified his reputation as
an able and daring soldier; and the final operations by which he
won Atlanta are not the least remarkable of the series which
carried him from Chattanooga ... into the heart of Georgia<a name=
"FNanchor1227"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1227">[1227]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But neither of these political-military "expert" journals would
acknowledge any benefit accruing to Lincoln from Sherman's success.
Not so, however, Lyons, who kept his chief much better informed
than he would have been if credulous of the British press. Lyons,
who for some time had been increasingly in bad health, had sought
escape from the summer heat of Washington in a visit to Montreal.
He now wrote correctly interpreting a great change in Northern
attitude and a renewed determination to persevere in the war until
reunion was secured. Lincoln, he thought, was likely to be
re-elected:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_234"></a>[V2:pg 234]</span>
<blockquote>"The reaction produced by the fall of Atlanta may be
taken as an indication of what the real feelings of the people in
the Northern States are. The vast majority of them ardently desire
to reconquer the lost territory. It is only at moments when they
despair of doing this that they listen to plans for recovering the
territory by negotiation. The time has not come yet when any
proposal to relinquish the territory can be publicly made<a name=
"FNanchor1228"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1228">[1228]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Times</i>, slowly convinced that Atlanta would have
influence in the election, and as always clever above its
contemporaries in the delicate process of face-about to save its
prestige, arrived in October at the point where it could join in
prediction of Lincoln's re-election. It did so by throwing the
blame on the Democratic platform adopted at the party convention in
Chicago, which, so it represented, had cast away an excellent
chance of success by declaring for union first and peace
afterwards. Since the convention had met in August this was late
analysis; and as a matter of fact the convention platform had
called for a "cessation of bloodshed" and the calling of a
convention to restore peace--in substance, for an armistice. But
the <i>Times</i><a name="FNanchor1229"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1229">[1229]</a> now assumed temporarily a highly moral
and disinterested pose and washed its hands of further
responsibility; Lincoln was likely to be re-elected:</p>
<blockquote>For ourselves we have no particular reason to wish it
otherwise. We have no very serious matter of complaint that we are
aware of against the present Government of America. Allowance being
made for the difficulties of their position, they are conducting
the war with a fair regard to the rights of neutral nations. The
war has swept American commerce from the sea, and placed it, in
great measure, in our hands; we have supplied the loss of the
cotton which was suddenly withdrawn from us; the returns of our
revenue and our trade are thoroughly satisfactory, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_235"></a>[V2:pg 235]</span>
have received an equivalent for the markets closed to us in America
in the vast impulse that has been given towards the development of
the prosperity of India. We see a great nation, which has not been
in times past sparing of its menaces and predictions of our ruin,
apparently resolved to execute, without pause and without remorse,
the most dreadful judgments of Heaven upon itself. We see the
frantic patient tearing the bandages from his wounds and thrusting
aside the hand that would assuage his miseries, and every day that
the war goes on we see less and less probability that the great
fabric of the Union will ever be reconstructed in its original
form, and more and more likelihood that the process of
disintegration will extend far beyond the present division between
North and South.... Were we really animated by the spirit of
hostility which is always assumed to prevail among us towards
America, we should view the terrible spectacle with exultation and
delight, we should rejoice that the American people, untaught by
past misfortunes, have resolved to continue the war to the end, and
hail the probable continuance of the power of Mr. Lincoln as the
event most calculated to pledge the nation to a steady continuance
in its suicidal policy. But we are persuaded that the people of
this country view the prospect of another four years of war in
America with very different feelings. They are not able to divest
themselves of sympathy for a people of their own blood and language
thus wilfully rushing down the path that leadeth to
destruction<a name="FNanchor1230"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1230">[1230]</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Sherman's capture of Atlanta did indeed make certain that
Lincoln would again be chosen President, but the <i>Times</i> was
more slow to acknowledge its military importance, first hinting and
then positively asserting that Sherman had fallen into a trap from
which he would have difficulty in escaping<a name=
"FNanchor1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231">[1231]</a>. The
<i>Gazette</i> called this "blind partisanship<a name=
"FNanchor1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232">[1232]</a>," but itself
indulged in gloomy prognostications as to the character and results
of the Presidential election, regarding it as certain that election
day would see the use of "force, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_236"></a>[V2:pg 236]</span> fraud and every mechanism known
to the most unscrupulous political agitation." "We confess," it
continued, "we are only so far affected by the struggle inasmuch as
it dishonours the Anglo-Saxon name, and diminishes its reputation
for justice and honour throughout the world<a name=
"FNanchor1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233">[1233]</a>." Again
official England was striking a note far different from that of the
press<a name="FNanchor1234"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1234">[1234]</a>. Adams paid little attention to
newspaper <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_237"></a>[V2:pg
237]</span> utterances, but kept his chief informed of opinions
expressed by those responsible for, and active in determining,
governmental policy. The autumn "season for speeches" by Members of
Parliament, he reported, was progressing with a very evident
unanimity of expressions, whether from friend or foe, that it was
inexpedient to meddle in American affairs. As the Presidential
election in America came nearer, attention was diverted from
military events. Anti-slavery societies began to hold meetings
urging their friends in America to vote for Lincoln<a name=
"FNanchor1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235">[1235]</a>. Writing
from Washington, Lyons, as always anxious to forestall frictions on
immaterial matters, wrote to Russell, "We must be prepared for
demonstrations of a '<i>spirited foreign policy</i>' by Mr. Seward,
during the next fortnight, for electioneering purposes<a name=
"FNanchor1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236">[1236]</a>." Possibly
his illness made him unduly nervous, for four days later he was
relieved to be asked by Seward to "postpone as much as possible all
business with him until after the election<a name=
"FNanchor1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237">[1237]</a>." By
November 1, Lyons was so ill that he asked for immediate leave, and
in replying, "You will come away at once," Russell added that he
was entirely convinced the United States wished to make no serious
difficulties with Great Britain.</p>
<blockquote>"... I do not think the U.S. Government have any
ill-intentions towards us, or any fixed purpose of availing
themselves of a tide of success to add a war with us to their
existing difficulties. Therefore whatever their bluster and buncome
may be at times, I think they will subside when the popular clamour
is over<a name="FNanchor1238"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1238">[1238]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_238"></a>[V2:pg 238]</span>
<p>In early November, Lincoln was triumphantly re-elected receiving
212 electoral votes to 21 cast for McClellan. No disturbances such
as the <i>Gazette</i> had gloomily foretold attended the event, and
the tremendous majority gained by the President somewhat stunned
the press. Having prophesied disorders, the <i>Gazette</i> now
patted America on the back for her behaviour, but took occasion to
renew old "professions of faith" against reunion:</p>
<blockquote>"Abraham Lincoln II reigns in succession to Abraham
Lincoln I, the first Republican monarch of the Federal States, and
so far as we are concerned we are very glad of it, because the
measure of the man is taken and known.... It is most creditable to
the law-abiding habits of the people that the elections ... passed
off as they have done.... Mr. Lincoln has four long years of strife
before him; and as he seems little inclined to change his advisers,
his course of action, or his generals, we do not believe that the
termination of his second period of government will find him
President of the United States<a name="FNanchor1239"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1239">[1239]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Times</i> was disinclined, for once, to moralize, and was
cautious in comment:</p>
<blockquote>"Ever since he found himself firmly established in his
office, and the first effervescence of national feeling had begun
to subside, we have had no great reason to complain of the conduct
of Mr. Lincoln towards England. His tone has been less exacting,
his language has been less offensive and, due allowance being made
for the immense difficulties of his situation, we could have parted
with Mr. Lincoln, had such been the pleasure of the American
people, without any vestige of ill-will or ill-feeling. He has done
as regards this country what the necessities of his situation
demanded from him, and he has done no more<a name=
"FNanchor1240"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1240">[1240]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_239"></a>[V2:pg 239]</span>
<p>This was to tread gently; but more exactly and more boldly the
real reaction of the press was indicated by <i>Punch's</i> cartoon
of a phoenix, bearing the grim and forceful face of Lincoln, rising
from the ashes where lay the embers of all that of old time had
gone to make up the <i>liberties</i> of America<a name=
"FNanchor1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241">[1241]</a>.</p>
<p>During the months immediately preceding Lincoln's re-election
English friends of the South had largely remained inactive.
Constantly twitted that at the chief stronghold of the <i>Southern
Independence Association</i>, Manchester, they did not dare to hold
a meeting in the great Free Trade Hall<a name=
"FNanchor1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242">[1242]</a>, they tried
ticket meetings in smaller halls, but even there met with
opposition from those who attended. At three other places, Oldham,
Ashton, and Stockport, efforts to break the Northern hold on the
manufacturing districts met with little success<a name=
"FNanchor1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243">[1243]</a>, and even,
as reported in the <i>Index</i>, were attended mainly by
"magistrates, clergy, leading local gentry, manufacturers,
tradesmen, and cotton operatives," the last named being also,
evidently, the last considered, and presumably the least
represented<a name="FNanchor1244"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1244">[1244]</a>. The Rev. Mr. Massie conducted "follow
up" Northern meetings wherever the Southern friends ventured an
appearance<a name="FNanchor1245"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1245">[1245]</a>. At one town only, Oldham, described by
<i>The Index</i> as "the most 'Southern' town in Lancashire," was a
meeting held at all comparable with the great demonstrations easily
staged by pro-Northern friends. Set for October 31, great efforts
were made to picture this meeting as an outburst of indignation
from the unemployed. Summoned by <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_240"></a>[V2:pg 240]</span> handbills headed "<i>The Crisis!
The Crisis! The Crisis!</i>" there gathered, according to <i>The
Index</i> correspondent, a meeting "of between 5,000 and 6,000
wretched paupers, many of whom were women with children in their
arms, who, starved apparently in body and spirit as in raiment, had
met together to exchange miseries, and ask one another what was to
be done." Desperate speeches were made, the people "almost
threatening violence," but finally adopting a resolution now become
so hackneyed as to seem ridiculous after a description intended to
portray the misery and the revolutionary character of the
meeting:</p>
<blockquote>"That in consequence of the widespread distress that
now prevails in the cotton districts by the continuance of the war
in America, this meeting is desirous that Her Majesty's Government
should use their influence, together with France and other European
powers, to bring both belligerents together in order to put a stop
to the vast destruction of life and property that is now going on
in that unhappy country<a name="FNanchor1246"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1246">[1246]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>No doubt this spectacular meeting was organized for effect, but
in truth it must have overshot the mark, for by October, 1864, the
distress in Lancashire was largely alleviated and the public knew
it, while elsewhere in the cotton districts the mass of operative
feeling was with the North. Even in Ireland petitions were being
circulated for signature among the working men, appealing to
Irishmen in America to stand by the administration of Lincoln and
to enlist in the Northern armies on the ground of
emancipation<a name="FNanchor1247"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1247">[1247]</a>. Here, indeed, was the insuperable
barrier, in the fall of 1864, to public support of the South. Deny
as he might the presence of the "foul blot" in Southern society,
Hotze, of <i>The Index</i>, could not counteract that phrase. When
the Confederate Congress at Richmond began, in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_241"></a>[V2:pg 241]</span> the autumn of
1864, seriously to discuss a plan of transforming slaves into
soldiers, putting guns in their hands, and thus replenishing the
waning man-power of Southern armies, Hotze was hard put to it to
explain to his English readers that this was in fact no evidence of
lowered strength, but rather a noble determination on the part of
the South to permit the negro to win his freedom by bearing arms in
defence of his country<a name="FNanchor1248"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1248">[1248]</a>.</p>
<p>This was far-fetched for a journal that had long insisted upon
the absolute incapacity of the black race. Proximity of dates,
however, permits another interpretation of Hotze's editorial of
November 10, and indeed of the project of arming the slaves, though
this, early in the spring of 1865, was actually provided for by
law. On November 11, Slidell, Mason and Mann addressed to the
Powers of Europe a communication accompanying a Confederate
"Manifesto," of which the blockade had long delayed transmissal.
This "Manifesto" set forth the objects of the Southern States and
flatly demanded recognition:</p>
<blockquote>"'All they ask is immunity from interference with their
internal peace and prosperity and to be left in the undisturbed
enjoyment of their inalienable rights of life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness which their common ancestry declared to be the
equal heritage of all parties to the Social compact<a name=
"FNanchor1249"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1249">[1249]</a>.'"</blockquote>
<p>Russell replied, November 25:</p>
<blockquote>"Great Britain has since 1783, remained, with the
exception of a short period, connected by friendly relations with
both the Northern and the Southern States. Since the commencement
of the Civil War which broke out in 1861, Her Majesty's Government
have continued to entertain sentiments of friendship equally for
the North and for the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_242"></a>[V2:pg 242]</span> South; of the causes of the
rupture Her Majesty's Government have never presumed to judge; they
deplored the commencement of this sanguinary struggle, and
anxiously look forward to the period of its termination. In the
meantime they are convinced that they best consult the interests of
peace, and respect the rights of all parties by observing a strict
and impartial Neutrality. Such a Neutrality Her Majesty has
faithfully maintained and will continue to maintain<a name=
"FNanchor1250"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1250">[1250]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>If <i>The Index</i> did indeed hope for results from the
"Manifesto," and had sought to bolster the appeal by dilating on a
Southern plan to "let the slaves win their freedom," the answer of
Russell was disappointing. Yet at the moment, in spite of the
effect of Lincoln's re-election, the current of alleged expert
military opinion was again swinging in favour of the South. The
<i>Times</i> scored Russell's answer, portraying him as attempting
to pose as "Our Mutual Friend":</p>
<blockquote>"The difficulty, of course, was to be polite to the
representatives of the Confederate States without appearing rude to
the United States; and, on the other hand, to acknowledge the
authority of the United States without affronting the dignity of
the Confederates. Between these two pitfalls Lord Russell
oscillates in his letter, and now puts his foot a little bit in the
hole on one side, and then, in recovering himself gets a little way
into the hole on the other side. In this way he sways to and fro
for a minute or two, but rights himself at last, and declares he
has hitherto stood upright between the two pitfalls, and he will
continue to do so.... Lord Russell seems to be in danger of
forgetting that <i>neuter</i> does not mean <i>both</i>, but
<i>neither</i>, and that if, therefore, he would maintain even in
words a strict neutrality it is necessary to avoid any
demonstrations of friendship to either belligerent<a name=
"FNanchor1251"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1251">[1251]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was harsh criticism, evincing a <i>Times</i> partisanship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_243"></a>[V2:pg 243]</span>
justifying the allegations of the <i>Gazette</i>, but wholly in
line with the opinion to which the <i>Times</i> was now desperately
clinging that Grant had failed and that Sherman, adventuring on his
spectacular "march to the sea" from Atlanta, was courting
annihilation. Yet even Northern friends were appalled at Sherman's
boldness and discouraged by Grant's slowness. The son of the
American Minister could write, "Grant moves like the iron wall in
Poe's story. You expect something tremendous, and it's only a step
after all<a name="FNanchor1252"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1252">[1252]</a>."</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> was at least consistent in prophecies until the
event falsified them; the <i>Gazette</i> less so. Some six weeks
after having acclaimed Sherman's generalship in the capture of
Atlanta<a name="FNanchor1253"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1253">[1253]</a>, the <i>Gazette's</i> summary of the
military situation was that:</p>
<blockquote>"... if the winter sees Grant still before Petersburg,
and Sherman unable to hold what he has gained in Georgia, the South
may be nearer its dawning day of independence than could have been
expected a few weeks ago, even though Wilmington be captured and
Charleston be ground away piecemeal under a distant cannonade. The
position of the Democrats would urge them to desperate measures,
and the wedge of discord will be driven into the ill-compacted body
which now represents the Federal States of North America<a name=
"FNanchor1254"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1254">[1254]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But on December 17, W.H. Russell again changed his view and
foretold with accuracy Sherman's movements toward Savannah. Not so
the <i>Times</i>, privately very anxious as to what Sherman's
campaign portended, while publicly belittling it. December 2, it
was noted that Sherman had not been heard from for weeks, having
left Atlanta with 50,000 men. December 5, his objective was stated
to be Savannah, and while the difficulties to be encountered were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_244"></a>[V2:pg 244]</span>
enumerated, no prophecy was indulged in. But on December 22,
Sherman's move was called a "desperate" one, forced by his
inability to retreat <i>northward</i> from Atlanta:</p>
<blockquote>"If we turn to military affairs, we are informed that
the great feature of the year is Sherman's expedition into Georgia.
We are not yet able to say whether Sherman will succeed in escaping
the fate of Burgoyne; but we know that his apparent rashness is
excused by the fact that Sherman was unable to return on the way by
which he came; so that the most remarkable feature of the war,
according to the President, is the wild and desperate effort of an
out-manoeuvred General to extricate himself from a position which,
whatever effect it may have had on the election, should never, on
mere military grounds, have been occupied at all<a name=
"FNanchor1255"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1255">[1255]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was followed up four days later by a long and careful
review of Sherman's whole western campaign, concluding with the
dictum that his sole object now was to escape to some undefended
point on the coast where he could be rescued by the Northern navy.
The war had taken a definite turn in favour of the South; it was
impossible to conceive that Sherman would venture to attack
Savannah:</p>
<blockquote>"For the escape or safety of Sherman and his army it is
essential he should reach Beaufort, or some neighbouring point on
the sea-coast as rapidly as possible. Delay would be equivalent to
ruin, and he will do nothing to create it<a name=
"FNanchor1256"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1256">[1256]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Rarely, if ever, did the <i>Times</i>, in its now eager and
avowed championship so definitely commit itself in an effort to
preserve British confidence in the Southern cause<a name=
"FNanchor1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257">[1257]</a>. Even
friends of the North were made doubtful <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_245"></a>[V2:pg 245]</span> by the
positiveness of prediction indulged in by that journal whose
opinions were supposed to be based on superior information. Their
recourse was to a renewal of "deputations" calling on the American
Minister to express steady allegiance to the Northern cause<a name=
"FNanchor1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258">[1258]</a>, and their
relief was great when the news was received that Savannah had
fallen, December 20, without a struggle. The <i>Times</i> recorded
the event, December 29, but with no comment save that Southern
prospects were less rosy than had been supposed. Then ensued a long
silence, for this time there was no possibility of that editorial
wiggling about the circle from excuses for misinterpretation to a
complacent resumption of authoritative utterance.</p>
<p>For the editor, Delane, and for wise Southern sympathizers the
fall of Savannah was a much harder blow than the mere loss of
prestige to the <i>Times</i><a name="FNanchor1259"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1259">[1259]</a>. Courage failed and confidence in the
South waned--momentarily almost vanished. Nearly two weeks passed
before the <i>Times</i> ventured to lift again the banner of hope,
and even then but half-heartedly.</p>
<blockquote>"The capture of the city completes the history of
Sherman's march, and stamps it as one of the ablest, certainly one
of the most singular military achievements of the war.<br>
<br>
"... The advantage gained for the Federal cause by the possession
of Savannah is yet to be shown. To Sherman and his army 'the change
of base' is indisputably a change for the better. Assuming that his
position at Atlanta was as <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_246"></a>[V2:pg 246]</span> desperate as shortness of
supplies and an interrupted line of retreat could make it, the
command of a point near the sea-coast and free communication with
the fleet is obviously an improvement. At the least the army
secures full means of subsistence, and a point from which further
operations may be commenced. On the other hand, the blow, as far as
the Confederate Government is concerned, is mitigated by the fact
that Savannah has been little used as a seaport since the capture
of Fort Pulaski by the Federals at an early stage of the war.<br>
<br>
"... But the fall of the city is a patent fact, and it would be
absurd to deny that it has produced an impression unfavourable to
the <i>prestige</i> of the Confederacy<a name=
"FNanchor1260"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1260">[1260]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Far more emphatic of ultimate Northern victory was the picture
presented, though in sarcasm, by the <i>Times</i> New York
correspondent, printed in this same issue:</p>
<blockquote>"No disappointments, however fast they may follow on
the heels of each other, can becloud the bright sunshine of conceit
and self-worship that glows in the heart of the Yankee. His country
is the first in the world, and he is the first man in it. Knock him
down, and he will get up again, and brush the dirt from his knees,
not a bit the worse for the fall. If he do not win this time, he is
bound to win the next. His motto is 'Never say die.' His manifest
destiny is to go on--prospering and to prosper--conquering and to
conquer."</blockquote>

North must win, I was tabooed from dealing with American questions
in the <i>Times</i> even after my return to England, but <i>en
revanche</i> I have had my say in the <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i>,
which I have bought, every week, and if one could be weak and
wicked enough to seek for a morbid gratification amid such ruins
and blood, I might be proud of the persistence with which I
maintained my opinions against adverse and unanimous sentiment"
(Bigelow, <i>Retrospections</i>, Vol. II, p. 361). Also on June 5,
1865, Russell wrote in his diary: "...had the <i>Times</i> followed
my advice, how different our position would be--not only that of
the leading journal, but of England. If ever I did State service,
it was in my letters from America." (Atkins, <i>Life of W.H.
Russell</i>, Vol. II, p. 115.) See also Bigelow,
<i>Retrospections</i>, I, pp. 344-45. Russell was editor of the
<i>Gazette</i> on its first appearance as a weekly, January 6,
1860, but left it to go to America. On his return he settled down
to his editorial task in November, 1862, and thereafter, throughout
the war, the <i>Gazette</i> may be regarded as reflecting his
views. His entire letters from America to the <i>Times</i>
constitute a most valuable picture of the months preceding the
outbreak of war, but the contempt poured on the Northern army for
its defeat at Bull Run made Russell much disliked in the North.
This dislike was bitterly displayed in a pamphlet by Andrew D.
White ("A Letter to William Howard Russell, LL.D., on passages in
his 'Diary North and South'"), published in London in
1863.</blockquote>

"#FNanchor1234">[1234]</a> According to <i>The Index</i>, the
French press was more divided than was the London press in
portrayal of military events in America. The <i>Si&egrave;cle</i>
and the <i>Opinion Nationale</i> pictured Sherman as about to
capture Atlanta. Readers of the <i>Constitutionel, Patrie,
Moniteur</i>, and <i>La France</i> "know quite well that Sherman
has neither occupied the centre, the circumference, nor, indeed,
any part of the defences of Atlanta; and that he was completely
defeated by General Hood on July 22." (<i>Index</i>, Aug. 18, 1864,
p. 522.) The Paris correspondent wrote, October 19, after the news
was received of Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah Valley:<br>
<br>
"The <i>Si&egrave;cle</i> is triumphant. According to this
humanitarian journal, whose sole policy consists in the expression
of a double hatred, part of which it bestows on the priests, and
part on the slave-dealers, the American contest has assumed its
last phase, the Confederates are running in breathless haste to
demand pardon, and true patriotism is at last to meet with its
reward. This great and noble result will be due to the Northern
generals, <i>who have carried military glory to so high a pitch
without at the same time compromising American Democracy!</i><br>
<br>
"Your readers will doubtless consider that the writer of the above
lines undertakes to speak on a subject of which he knows nothing;
but what will they say of a writer who, in the same journal, thus
expresses himself relative to the issues of the coming
election?<br>
<br>
'Lincoln being elected, the following will be the results: The
South will lose courage and abandon the contest; the lands reduced
to barrenness by servile labour will be again rendered productive
by the labour of the freeman; the Confederates, <i>who know only
how to fight, and who are supported by the sweat of others</i>,
will purify and regenerate themselves by the exercise of their own
brains and of their own hands....'<br>
<br>
"These strange remarks conclude with words of encouragement to the
robust-shouldered, iron-fronted, firm-lipped Lincoln, and prayers
for the welfare of the American brethren.<br>
<br>
"You will not easily credit it, but this article--a very
masterpiece of delirium and absurdity--bears the signature of one
of the most eminent writers of the day, M. Henri Martin, the
celebrated historian of France. (<i>Index</i>, Oct. 20, 1864, p.
667.)<br>
<br>
A week later <i>The Index</i> was vicious in comment upon the "men
and money" pouring out of <i>Germany</i> in aid of the North.
German financiers, under the guise of aiding emigration, were
engaged in the prosperous business of "selling white-skinned
Germans to cut Southern throats for the benefit, as they say, of
the poor blacks." (Oct. 27, 1864, p. 685.) This bitter tone was
indulged in even by the Confederate Secretary of State. Benjamin
wrote to Slidell, September 20, 1864, that France was wilfully
deceiving the South by professions of friendship. The President, he
stated, "could not escape the painful conviction that the Emperor
of the French, knowing that the utmost efforts of this people are
engrossed in the defence of their homes against an atrocious
warfare waged by greatly superior numbers, has thought the occasion
opportune for promoting his own purposes, at no greater cost than a
violation of his faith and duty toward us." (Richardson, II, p.
577.)</blockquote>

British dignity yet never gave offence to that of America; he

of the difficulties of the Northern Government. No doubt he was at
heart so unneutral as to hope for Northern success, even though at
first sharing in the view that there was small possibility of
reunion, but this very hope--unquestionably known to Seward and to
Lincoln--frequently eased dangerous moments in the relations with

<h3>THE END OF THE WAR</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"I think you need not trouble yourself about England.
At this moment opinion seems to have undergone a complete change,
and our people and indeed our Government is more moderately
disposed than I have ever before known it to be. I hear from a
member of the Government that it is believed that the feeling
between our Cabinet and the Washington Government has been steadily
improving<a name="FNanchor1261"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1261">[1261]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Thus wrote Bright to Sumner in the last week of January, 1865.
Three weeks later he again wrote in reassurance against American
rumours that Europe was still planning some form of intervention to
save the South: "<i>All parties and classes</i> here are resolved
on a strict neutrality<a name="FNanchor1262"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1262">[1262]</a>...." This was a correct estimate. In
spite of a temporary pause in the operations of Northern armies and
of renewed assertions from the South that she "would never submit,"
British opinion was now very nearly unanimous that the end was
near. This verdict was soon justified by events. In January, 1865,
Wilmington, North Carolina, was at last captured by a combined sea
and land attack. Grant, though since midsummer, 1864, held in check
by Lee before Petersburg, was yet known to be constantly increasing
the strength of his army, while his ability to strike when the time
came was made evident by the freedom with which his cavalry scoured
the country about the Confederate <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_248"></a>[V2:pg 248]</span> capital, Richmond--in one raid
even completely encircling that city. Steadily Lee's army lost
strength by the attrition of the siege, by illness and, what was
worse, by desertion since no forces could be spared from the
fighting front to recover and punish the deserters. Grant waited
for the approach of spring, when, with the advance northwards of
the army at Savannah, the pincers could be applied to Lee, to end,
it was hoped, in writing <i>finis</i> to the war.</p>
<p>From December 20, 1864, to February 1, 1865, Sherman remained in
Savannah, renewing by sea the strength of his army. On the latter
date he moved north along the coast, meeting at first no resistance
and easily overrunning the country. Columbia, capital of South
Carolina, was burned. Charleston was evacuated, and it was not
until March, in North Carolina, that any real opposition to the
northward progress was encountered. Here on the sixteenth and the
nineteenth, Johnston, in command of the weak Southern forces in
North Carolina, made a desperate effort to stop Sherman, but
without avail, and on March 23, Sherman was at Goldsboro, one
hundred and sixty miles south of Richmond, prepared to cut off the
retreat of Lee when Grant should at last take up an energetic
offensive.</p>
<p>In the last week of March, Grant began cutting off supplies to
Richmond, thus forcing Lee, if he wished still to protect the
Southern capital, to come out of his lines at Petersburg and
present an unfortified front. The result was the evacuation of
Petersburg and the abandonment of Richmond, Jefferson Davis and his
Government fleeing from the city on the night of April 2.
Attempting to retreat southwards with the plan of joining
Johnston's army, Lee, on April 9, found his forces surrounded at
Appomattox and surrendered. Nine days later, on April 18, Johnston
surrendered to Sherman at Durham, North Carolina. It was the end of
the war and of the Confederacy.</p>

<br>
<p>The rapidity with which Southern resistance in arms <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_249"></a>[V2:pg 249]</span> crumbled in
1865 when once Sherman and Grant were under way no doubt startled
foreign observers, but in British opinion, at least, the end had
been foreseen from the moment Sherman reached the sea at Savannah.
The desperate courage of the South was admired, but regarded as
futile. Equally desperate and futile was the last diplomatic effort
of the Confederate agents in Europe, taking the form of an offer to
abolish slavery in return for recognition. The plan originated with
Benjamin, Southern Secretary of State, was hesitatingly approved by
Davis<a name="FNanchor1263"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1263">[1263]</a>, and was committed to Mason for
negotiation with Great Britain. Mason, after his withdrawal from
London, had been given duplicate powers in blank for any point to
which emergencies might send him, thus becoming a sort of
Confederate Commissioner at Large to Europe. Less than any other
representative abroad inclined to admit that slavery was other than
a beneficent and humane institution, it was felt advisable at
Richmond not only to instruct Mason by written despatch, but by
personal messenger also of the urgency of presenting the offer of
abolition promptly and with full assurance of carrying it into
effect. The instruction was therefore entrusted to Duncan F.
Kenner, of Louisiana, and he arrived in Paris early in March, 1865,
overcame Mason's unwillingness to carry such an offer to England,
and accompanied the latter to London.</p>
<p>The time was certainly not propitious, for on the day Mason
reached London there came the news of the burning of Columbia and
the evacuation of Charleston. Mason hesitated to approach
Palmerston, but was pressed by Kenner who urged action on the
theory that Great Britain did not wish to see a reconstruction of
the Union<a name="FNanchor1264"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1264">[1264]</a>. Slidell, in Paris, on receiving
Mason's doubts, advised waiting until the Emperor had been
consulted, was granted an interview <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_250"></a>[V2:pg 250]</span> and reported Napoleon III as
ready as ever to act if England would act also, but as advising
delay until more favourable news was received from America<a name=
"FNanchor1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265">[1265]</a>. But Mason's
instructions did not permit delay; he must either carry them out or
resign--and Kenner was at his elbow pressing for action. On March
13, therefore, Mason wrote to Palmerston asking for a private
interview and was promptly granted one for the day following.</p>
<p>Both personal disinclination to the proposal of abolition and
judgment that nothing would come of it made Mason cautious in
expressing himself to Palmerston. Mason felt that he was
stultifying his country in condemning slavery. Hence in roundabout
language, "with such form of allusion to the <i>concession</i> we
held in reserve, as would make him necessarily comprehend
it<a name="FNanchor1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266">[1266]</a>,"
and turning again and again to a supposed "latent, undisclosed
obstacle<a name="FNanchor1267"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1267">[1267]</a>" to British recognition, Mason yet made
clear the object of his visit. The word slavery was not mentioned
by him, but Palmerston promptly denied that slavery in the South
had ever been, or was now, a barrier to recognition; British
objections to recognition were those which had long since been
stated, and there was nothing "underlying" them. On March 26, Mason
called on the Earl of Donoughmore, a Tory friend of the South with
whom he had long been in close touch, and asked whether he thought
Palmerston's Government could be induced by a Southern abolition of
slavery to recognize the Confederacy. The reply was "that the time
had gone by now...." This time the words "slavery" and "abolition"
were spoken boldly<a name="FNanchor1268"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1268">[1268]</a>, and Donoughmore was positive that if,
in the midsummer of 1863, when Lee was invading Pennsylvania, the
South had made its present overture, nothing could have prevented
British recognition. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_251"></a>[V2:pg 251]</span> The opinion clashed with Mason's
own conviction, but in any case no more was to be hoped, now, from
his overture. Only a favourable turn in the war could help the
South.</p>
<p>There was no public knowledge in London of this "last card"
Southern effort in diplomacy, though there were newspaper rumours
that some such move was on foot, but with a primary motive of
restoring Southern fighting power by putting the negroes in arms.
British public attention was fixed rather upon a possible
last-moment reconciliation of North and South and a restored Union
which should forget its domestic troubles in a foreign war.
Momentarily somewhat of a panic overcame London society and gloomy
were the forebodings that Great Britain would be the chosen enemy
of America. Like rumours were afloat at Washington also. The
Russian Minister, Stoeckl, reported to his Government that he had
learned from "a sure source" of representations made to Jefferson
Davis by Blair, a prominent Unionist and politician of the border
state of Maryland, looking to reconstruction and to the sending by
Lincoln of armies into Canada and Mexico. Stoeckl believed such a
war would be popular, but commented that "Lincoln might change his
mind<a name="FNanchor1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269">[1269]</a>
to-morrow." In London the <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i> declared
that Davis could not consent to reunion and that Lincoln could not
offer any other terms of peace, but that a truce might be patched
up on the basis of a common aggression against supposed foreign
enemies<a name="FNanchor1270"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1270">[1270]</a>. Adams pictured all British society as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_252"></a>[V2:pg 252]</span>
now convinced that the end of the war was near, and bitter against
the previous tone and policy of such leaders of public opinion as
the <i>Times</i>, adding that it was being "whispered about that if
the feud is reconciled and the Union restored, and a great army
left on our hands, the next manifestation will be one of hostility
to this country<a name="FNanchor1271"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1271">[1271]</a>."</p>
<p>The basis of all this rumour was Blair's attempt to play the
mediator. He so far succeeded that on January 31, 1865, Lincoln
instructed Seward to go to Fortress Monroe to meet "commissioners"
appointed by Davis. But Lincoln made positive in his instructions
three points:</p>
<blockquote>(1) Complete restoration of the Union.<br>
<br>
(2) No receding on emancipation.<br>
<br>
(3) No cessation of hostilities "short of an end of the war, and
the disbanding of all forces hostile to the
Government."</blockquote>
<p>A few days later the President decided that his own presence was
desirable and joined his Secretary of State in the "Hampton Roads
Conference" of February 3. It quickly appeared that the
Confederates did indeed hope to draw the North into a foreign war
for a "traditional American object," using the argument that
<i>after</i> such a war restoration of the Union would be easily
accomplished. The enemy proposed was not Great Britain but France,
and the place of operations Mexico. There was much discussion of
this plan between Seward and Stephens, the leading Southern
Commissioner, but Lincoln merely listened, and when pressed for
comment stuck fast to his decision that no agreement whatever would
be entered into until the South had laid down its arms. The
Southerners urged that there was precedent for an agreement in
advance of cessation of hostilities in the negotiations between
Charles I and the Roundheads. Lincoln's reply was pithy: "I do not
profess to be posted in history. On all such matters I turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_253"></a>[V2:pg 253]</span>
you over to Seward. All I distinctly recollect about the case of
Charles I is that he lost his head in the end<a name=
"FNanchor1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272">[1272]</a>."</p>
<p>When news of the holding of this conference reached England
there occurred a panic on the Stock Exchange due to the uncertainty
created by the prospect of an immediate end of the American War.
"The consternation," wrote Adams, "was extraordinary<a name=
"FNanchor1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273">[1273]</a>." What did
the United States intend to do? "The impression is now very general
that peace and restoration at home are synonymous with war with
this country." There existed an "extraordinary uneasiness and
indefinite apprehension as to the future." So reported Adams to
Seward; and he advised that it might be well for the United States
"to consider the question how far its policy may be adapted to
quiet this disturbance"; due allowance should be made for the
mortification of those leaders who had been so confident of
Southern victory and for expressions that might now fall from their
lips; it was possible that reassurances given by the United States
might aid in the coming elections in retaining the Government in
power--evidently, in Adams' opinion, a result to be desired<a name=
"FNanchor1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274">[1274]</a>.</p>
<p>Adams' advice as to the forthcoming elections was but repetition
of that given earlier and with more emphasis<a name=
"FNanchor1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275">[1275]</a>. Apparently
Seward was then in no mood to act on it, for his reply was
distinctly belligerent in tone, recapitulating British and Canadian
offences in permitting the enemy to use their shores, and asserting
that the measures now proposed of abrogating the reciprocity treaty
of 1854 with Canada and the agreement of 1817 prohibiting armaments
on the Great Lakes, were but defensive measures required to protect
American soil<a name="FNanchor1276"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1276">[1276]</a>. These matters Adams had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_254"></a>[V2:pg 254]</span>
instructed to take up with Russell, but with discretion as to time
and he had ventured to postpone them as inopportune. Professing
entire agreement with the justice of Seward's complaints he
nevertheless wrote that to press them "at this moment would be only
playing into the hands of the mischief-makers, and disarming our
own friends<a name="FNanchor1277"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1277">[1277]</a>." The day before this was written home
Seward, at Washington, on March 8, recalled his instruction as to
the agreement of 1817, stating that Russell might be informed the
United States had no intention of increasing its armaments on the
Great Lakes<a name="FNanchor1278"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1278">[1278]</a>.</p>
<p>Thus there were incidents offering ground for a British
excitement over a prospective war with America, even though no such
intention was seriously entertained by the North. The British
Government did not share this fear, but Delane, of the
<i>Times</i>, kept it alive in the public mind, and indeed was
sincere in efforts to arouse his readers to the danger. "I do not
know what grounds Delane has for it," wrote W.H. Russell to his
American friend Bigelow, "but he is quite sure Uncle Samuel is
about to finish off the dreadful Civil War with another war with us
scarcely less horrible<a name="FNanchor1279"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1279">[1279]</a>." Governmental circles, however,
belittled the agitation. Burnley, temporarily representing England
at Washington, was assured by Seward, and so reported, that all
these rumours of a foreign war were of Southern origin, had in fact
been actually elaborated at the Hampton Roads Conference, but were
perfectly understood by the North as but part of the Southern game,
and that the Southern offer had been flatly refused<a name=
"FNanchor1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280">[1280]</a>. In a
parliamentary debate in the Commons on March 13, arising out of
governmental estimates for military expenditures in Canada,
opportunity was given for a discussion of relations with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_255"></a>[V2:pg 255]</span>
America. A few Members gave voice to the fear of war, but the
general tone of the debate was one of confidence in the continuance
of peaceful relations. Bright, in a vigorous and witty speech,
threw right and left criticisms of Parliament, the Press, and
individuals, not sparing members of the Government, but expressed
the utmost confidence in the pacific policy of Lincoln. As one
known to be in close touch with America his words carried
weight<a name="FNanchor1281"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1281">[1281]</a>. Palmerston gave assurances that the
present relations between the two Governments were perfectly
friendly and satisfactory. The effect of the debate, reported
Adams, was to quiet the panic<a name="FNanchor1282"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1282">[1282]</a>, yet at the same time England was now
awake to and somewhat alarmed by, America's "prodigious development
of physical power during the war." To quiet this, Adams recommended
"prudence and moderation in tone<a name="FNanchor1283"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1283">[1283]</a>."</p>
<p>Thus the actual cessation of hostilities in America and the
possible effect of this event on foreign relations had been for
some time anticipated and estimated in Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284">[1284]</a>. The news of
Lee's surrender, therefore, caused no great surprise since the
<i>Times</i> and other papers had been preparing the public for
it<a name="FNanchor1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285">[1285]</a>.
Newspaper comment on the event followed closely that of the
<i>Times</i>, rendering honour to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_256"></a>[V2:pg 256]</span> the militant qualities of the
South and to Lee, but writing <i>finis</i> to the war:</p>
<blockquote>"Such is the end of the great army which, organized by
the extraordinary genius of one man, aided by several other
commanders of eminent ability, has done such wonders in this war.
Not even the Grand Army of Napoleon himself could count a series of
more brilliant victories than the force which, raised chiefly from
the high-spirited population of Virginia, has defeated so many
invasions of the State, and crushed the hopes of so many Northern
generals. Chief and soldiers have now failed for the first and last
time. They were victorious until victory was no longer to be
achieved by human valour, and then they fell with honour<a name=
"FNanchor1286"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1286">[1286]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The people of the North, also, were complimented for their
slowly developed but ultimate ability in war, and especially for "a
patience, a fortitude, and an energy which entitle them to rank
among the very first of military nations<a name=
"FNanchor1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287">[1287]</a>." No one
remained to uphold the Southern banner in Europe save the
Confederate agents, and, privately, even they were hopeless. Mason,
it is true, asserted, as if bolstering his own courage, that "this
morning's" news did not mean an overwhelming disaster; it could not
be wholly true; even if true it must mean peace on the basis of
separation; finally, "5th. <i>I know</i> that no terms of peace
would be accepted that did not embrace independence." But at the
conclusion of this letter he acknowledged:</p>
<blockquote>"I confess that all this speculation rests on, what I
assume, that Lee surrendered only in expectation of a peace derived
from his interview with Grant--and that no terms of peace would be
entertained that did not rest on <i>independence</i><a name=
"FNanchor1288"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1288">[1288]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But Slidell saw more clearly. He replied:</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot share your hopefulness. We have seen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_257"></a>[V2:pg 257]</span>
beginning of the end. I, for my part, am prepared for the worst.
With Lee's surrender there will soon be an end to our regular
organized armies and I can see no possible good to result from a
protracted guerilla warfare. We are crushed and must submit to the
yoke. Our children must bide their time for vengeance, but you and
I will never revisit our homes under our glorious flag. For myself
I shall never put my foot on a soil from which flaunts the hated
Stars and Stripes.... I am sick, sick at heart<a name=
"FNanchor1289"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1289">[1289]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The news of Lee's surrender arrived at the same moment with that
of a serious injury to Seward in a runaway accident, and in its
editorial on the end of the war the <i>Times</i> took occasion to
pay a tribute to the statesman whom it had been accustomed to
berate.</p>
<blockquote>"There seems to be on the part of President Lincoln a
desire to conciliate vanquished fellow-citizens. Under the guidance
of Mr. Seward, who has creditably distinguished himself in the
Cabinet by his moderate counsels, and whose life will, we trust, be
spared at this crisis to the Union, he may by gentle measures
restore tranquillity, and perhaps, before his term of office
expires, calm in some degree the animosities which have been raised
by these years of war<a name="FNanchor1290"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1290">[1290]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Nor was this insincere, for Seward had, first in the estimate of
British statesmen, more slowly in the press and with the public,
come to be regarded in an aspect far different from that with which
he was generally viewed in 1861. There was real anxiety at the
reports of Seward's accident, but when, in less than a week, there
was received also the news of the assassination of Lincoln and of
the brutal attack on Seward, all England united in expressions of
sympathy and horror. "Few events of the present century," wrote
Adams, "have created such general consternation and
indignation<a name="FNanchor1291"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1291">[1291]</a>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_258"></a>[V2:pg 258]</span>
<p>In Ford's Theatre on the evening of April 14, Lincoln was shot
by Booth, a fanatical Southerner, who had gained entrance to the
box where the President was sitting. Lincoln died early the next
morning. On the same evening, at about ten o'clock, an unknown man
was admitted to Seward's house on the plea that he had a message
from the physician, passed upstairs, but was stopped by Seward's
son at the door of the sick room. Beating the son into
semi-unconsciousness with a revolver which had missed fire, the
stranger burst open the door, attacked the Secretary as he lay in
bed with a bowie-knife, slashing at his throat, until Seward rolled
off the bed to the floor. Seward's throat was "cut on both sides,
his right cheek nearly severed from his face"; his life was saved,
probably, because of an iron frame worn to support the jaw
fractured in the runaway accident nine days before<a name=
"FNanchor1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292">[1292]</a>. The
assailant fought his way out of the house and escaped. For some
days Seward's life was despaired of, whether from his injuries or
from shock.</p>
<p>These tragic occurrences were the outcome of a revengeful spirit
in the hearts of a few extreme Southerners, and in no sense
represented the feeling of the South. It was inevitable, however,
that abroad so horrible a crime should react both to the detriment
of the Confederacy and to the advantage of the North. Sympathy with
the North took the form of a sudden exaltation of the personality
of Lincoln, bringing out characterizations of the man far different
from those which had been his earlier in the war. The presence of a
"rural attorney" in the Presidential office had seemed like the
irony of fate in the great crisis of 1861. Even so acute an
observer as Lyons could then write, "Mr. Lincoln has not hitherto
given proof of his possessing any natural talents to compensate for
his ignorance of everything but Illinois village politics. He seems
to be well meaning <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_259"></a>[V2:pg 259]</span> and conscientious, in the
measure of his understanding, but not much more<a name=
"FNanchor1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293">[1293]</a>." But Lyons
was no more blind than his contemporaries, for nearly all
characterizations, whether American or foreign, were of like
nature.</p>
<p>But the slow progress of the years of war had brought a
different estimate of Lincoln--a curious blending of admiration for
the growth of his personal authority and for his steadiness of
purpose, with criticism of his alleged despotism. Now, with his
death, following so closely the collapse of the Confederacy, there
poured out from British press and public a great stream of
laudation for Lincoln almost amounting to a national recantation.
In this process of "whitening Abraham's tomb," as a few
dyed-in-the-wool Southern sympathizers called it, <i>Punch</i> led
the way in a poem by Tom Taylor:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>You</i> lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's
bier,<br>
<i>You</i>, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,<br>
Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,<br>
His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
"Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,<br>
To lame my pencil and confute my pen--<br>
To make me own this hind of princes peer,<br>
This rail-splitter a true-born king of men<a name=
"FNanchor1294"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1294">[1294]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Less emotional than most papers, but with a truer estimate of
Lincoln, stood the <i>Times</i>. Severely reprobating the act of
Booth and prophesying a disastrous effect in the treatment of the
conquered South, it proceeded:</p>
<blockquote>"Starting from a humble position to one of the greatest
eminence, and adopted by the Republican party as a make-shift,
simply because Mr. Seward and their other prominent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_260"></a>[V2:pg 260]</span> leaders were
obnoxious to different sections of the party, it was natural that
his career should be watched with jealous suspicion. The office
cast upon him was great, its duties most onerous, and the obscurity
of his past career afforded no guarantee of his ability to
discharge them. His shortcomings moreover were on the surface. The
education of a man whose early years had been spent in earning
bread by manual labour had necessarily been defective, and faults
of manner and errors of taste repelled the observer at the outset.
In spite of these drawbacks, Mr. Lincoln slowly won for himself the
respect and confidence of all. His perfect honesty speedily became
apparent, and, what is, perhaps, more to his credit, amid the many
unstudied speeches which he was called upon from time to time to
deliver, imbued though they were with the rough humour of his early
associates, he was in none of them betrayed into any intemperance
of language towards his opponents or towards neutrals. His
utterances were apparently careless, but his tongue was always
under command. The quality of Mr. Lincoln's administration which
served, however, more than any other to enlist the sympathy of
bystanders was its conservative progress. He felt his way gradually
to his conclusions, and those who will compare the different stages
of his career one with another will find that his mind was growing
throughout the course of it."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"The gradual change of his language and of his policy was most
remarkable. Englishmen learnt to respect a man who showed the best
characteristics of their race in his respect for what is good in
the past, acting in unison with a recognition of what was made
necessary by the events of passing history<a name=
"FNanchor1295"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1295">[1295]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>This was first reaction. Two days later, commenting on the far
warmer expressions of horror and sympathy emanating from all
England, there appeared another and longer editorial:</p>
<blockquote>"If anything could mitigate the distress of the
American people in their present affliction, it might surely be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_261"></a>[V2:pg 261]</span>
sympathy which is expressed by the people of this country. We are
not using the language of hyperbole in describing the manifestation
of feeling as unexampled. Nothing like it has been witnessed in our
generation.... But President Lincoln was only the chief of a
foreign State, and of a State with which we were not infrequently
in diplomatic or political collision. He might have been regarded
as not much more to us than the head of any friendly Government,
and yet his end has already stirred the feelings of the public to
their uttermost depths."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"... a space of twenty-four hours has sufficed not only to fill the
country with grief and indignation, but to evoke almost
unprecedented expressions of feeling from constituted bodies. It
was but on Wednesday that the intelligence of the murder reached
us, and on Thursday the Houses of Lords and Commons, the
Corporation of the City of London, and the people of our chief
manufacturing towns in public meeting assembled had recorded their
sentiments or expressed their views. In the House of Lords the
absence of precedent for such a manifestation was actually made the
subject of remark.<br>
<br>
"That much of this extraordinary feeling is due to the tragical
character of the event and the horror with which the crime is
regarded is doubtless true, nor need we dissemble the the fact that
the loss which the Americans have sustained is also thought our own
loss in so far as one valuable guarantee for the amity of the two
nations may have been thus removed. But, upon the whole, it is
neither the possible embarrassment of international relations nor
the infamous wickedness of the act itself which has determined
public feeling. The preponderating sentiment is sincere and genuine
sympathy--- sorrow for the chief of a great people struck down by
an assassin, and sympathy for that people in the trouble which at a
crisis of their destinies such a catastrophe must bring. Abraham
Lincoln was as little of a tyrant as any man who ever lived. He
could have been a tyrant had he pleased, but he never uttered so
much as an ill-natured speech.... In all America there was,
perhaps, not one man who less deserved to be the victim of this
revolution than he who has just fallen<a name=
"FNanchor1296"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1296">[1296]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_262"></a>[V2:pg 262]</span>
<p>The Ministry did not wait for public pressure. Immediately on
receipt of the news, motions were made, April 27, in both Lords and
Commons for an address to the Queen, to be debated "Monday next,"
expressing "sorrow and indignation" at the assassination of
Lincoln<a name="FNanchor1297"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1297">[1297]</a>. April 28, Russell instructed Bruce to
express at Washington that "the Government, the Parliament, and the
Nation are affected by a unanimous feeling of abhorrence of the
criminals guilty of these cowardly and atrocious crimes, and
sympathy for the Government and People of the United States<a name=
"FNanchor1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298">[1298]</a>...." Russell
wrote here of both Lincoln and Seward. The Queen wrote a personal
letter of sympathy to Mrs. Lincoln. Already Bruce had written from
Washington that Lincoln "was the only friend of the South in his
party<a name="FNanchor1299"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1299">[1299]</a>," and he was extremely anxious that
Seward's recovery might be hastened, fearing the possibility of
Sumner's assumption of the Secretaryship of State. "We miss
terribly the comparative moderation of Lincoln and Seward<a name=
"FNanchor1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300">[1300]</a>."</p>

<b>BRITANNIA SYMPATHISES WITH COLUMBIA.</b><br>
<i>Reproduced by permission of the Proprietors of "Punch"</i></p>
<br>
<p>The American Minister naturally became the centre toward which
the public outpouring of sympathy was directed. "The excitement in
this country has been deep and wide, spreading through all classes
of society. My table is piled high with cards, letters and
resolutions<a name="FNanchor1301"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1301">[1301]</a>...." Indeed all the old sources of
"addresses" to Adams on emancipation and many organizations having
no professed interest in that subject now sent to him
resolutions--the emancipation societies, of horror, indignation,
and even accusation against the South; the others of sympathy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_263"></a>[V2:pg 263]</span>
more moderate in tone, yet all evincing an appreciation of the
great qualities of Lincoln and of the justice of the cause of the
North, now victorious. Within two weeks Adams reported over four
hundred such addresses from Emancipation Societies, Chambers of
Commerce, Trades Unions, municipalities, boroughs, churches, indeed
from every known type of British organizations<a name=
"FNanchor1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302">[1302]</a>.</p>
<p>On May 1 the motion for the address to the Crown came up for
debate. In the Lords, Russell emphasized the kindly and forgiving
qualities of Lincoln as just those needed in America, and now lost
by his death. Derby, for the Opposition, expressed the horror of
the world at Booth's act, joined in expressions of sympathy to the
United States, but repeated the old phrase about the "North
fighting for empire, the South for independence," and hinted that
the unusual step now being taken by Parliament had in it a
"political object," meaning that the motion had been introduced in
the hope of easing American irritation with Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303">[1303]</a>. It was not
a tactful speech, but Derby's lieutenant in the Commons, Disraeli,
saved his party from criticism by what was distinctly the most
thoughtful and best-prepared utterance of the day. Palmerston was
ill. The Government speech was made by Grey, who incautiously began
by asserting that the majority of the people of Great Britain had
always been on the side of the North and was met by cries of "No,
no" and "Hear, hear." Disraeli concluded the debate. He said:</p>
<blockquote>"There are rare instances when the sympathy of a nation
approaches those tenderer feelings that generally speaking, are
supposed to be peculiar to the individual, and to form the happy
privilege of private life; and this is one. Under all circumstances
we should have bewailed the catastrophe at Washington; under all
circumstances we should have <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_264"></a>[V2:pg 264]</span> shuddered at the means by which
it was accomplished. But in the character of the victim, and even
in the accessories of his last moments there is something so homely
and so innocent that it takes as it were the subject out of all the
pomp of history and the ceremonial of diplomacy; it touches the
heart of nations, and appeals to the domestic sentiment of
mankind.<br>
<br>
"Sir, whatever the various and varying opinions in this House, and
in the country generally on the policy of the late President of the
United States, on this, I think, all must agree, that in one of the
severest trials which ever tested the moral qualities of man, he
fulfilled his duty with simplicity and strength. Nor is it possible
for the people of England, at such a moment, to forget that he
sprang from the same fatherland, and spoke the same mother
tongue.<br>
<br>
"When such crimes are perpetrated the public mind is apt to fall
into gloom and perplexity; for it is ignorant alike of the causes
and the consequences of such deeds. But it is one of our duties to
reassure the country under unreasoning panic or despondency.
Assassination has never changed the history of the world....<br>
<br>
"In expressing our unaffected and profound sympathy with the
citizens of the United States at the untimely end of their elected
Chief, let us not, therefore, sanction any feeling of depression,
but rather let us express a fervent hope that from out the awful
trials of the last four years, of which not the least is this
violent demise, the various populations of North America may issue
elevated and chastened; rich in that accumulated wisdom, and strong
in that disciplined energy which a young nation can only acquire in
a protracted and perilous struggle. Then they will be enabled not
merely to renew their career of power and prosperity, but they will
renew it to contribute to the general happiness of mankind. It is
with these feelings, Sir, that I second the Address to the
Crown<a name="FNanchor1304"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1304">[1304]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Lincoln's assassination served to bring out not only British
popular sympathy, but also the certitude that the war was over and
the North victorious. But officially the Government had not yet
recognized this. Even as early as January, 1865, Seward had
returned to the old proposal <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_265"></a>[V2:pg 265]</span> that the nations of Europe
should withdraw their recognition of Southern belligerent
rights<a name="FNanchor1305"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1305">[1305]</a>, and in March he had asked Stoeckl, the
Russian Minister, whether Russia would not lead in the suggestion
of this measure to England and France<a name=
"FNanchor1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306">[1306]</a>. Meanwhile
Sherman's army was rapidly advancing northward and reports were
arriving of its pillagings and burnings. March 20, Gregory asked in
the Commons whether the Government was taking any steps to prevent
the destruction of British property and received from Layard an
evasive reply. Merely a "confident hope" had been expressed to the
United States that "every facility will be given" to British
subjects to prove ownership of property<a name=
"FNanchor1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307">[1307]</a>. Evidently
the Government was not eager to raise irritating questions at a
moment when all eyes were strained to observe the concluding events
of the war.</p>
<p>Then came the news of Lee's surrender and of the assassination
of Lincoln, with the attack on Seward, already incapacitated from
active duties. Seward's illness delayed American pressure on
England--a fortunate circumstance in the relations with Great
Britain in that it gave time for a clearer appreciation of the
rapidity and completeness of the collapse of the South. May 15,
Lord Houghton asked whether the Government did not intend, in view
of recent events in America, "to withdraw the admission of
belligerent rights conceded to the so-called Confederate States."
Russell promptly objected to the form of the question: England had
not "conceded" any rights to the South--she had merely issued a
proclamation of neutrality after Lincoln had declared the existence
of a war by proclaiming a blockade. England had had no other
recourse, unless she chose to refuse recognition of the blockade,
and this would have drawn her into the war. As to a withdrawal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_266"></a>[V2:pg 266]</span> of
the neutrality proclamation this must wait upon official
announcement from the United States that the war was at an end.
Texas was still in arms and Galveston still blockaded, and for this
section the United States would no doubt continue to exercise on
neutral vessels a belligerent right of search. It followed that if
Great Britain did prematurely withdraw her proclamation of
neutrality and the United States searched a British vessel, it
would be the exercise of a right of search in time of peace--an act
against which Great Britain would be bound to make vigorous
protest. Hence England must wait on American action proclaiming the
end of the war. Russell concluded by expressing gratification at
the prospect of peace<a name="FNanchor1308"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1308">[1308]</a>.</p>
<p>But matters were not to take this orderly and logical course.
Seward, though still extremely weak and confined to his home, was
eager to resume the duties of office, and on May 9 a Cabinet was
held at his house. A week later Bruce wrote to Russell in some
anxiety that America was about to <i>demand</i> the withdrawal by
Great Britain of belligerent rights to the South, that if Great
Britain would but act before such a demand was made it would serve
to continue the existing good feeling in America created by the
sympathy over Lincoln's death, and especially, that there was a
decided danger to good relations in the fact that Confederate
cruisers were still at large. He urged that orders should be sent
to stop their presence in British colonial ports securing coal and
supplies<a name="FNanchor1309"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1309">[1309]</a>. Three days later Bruce repeated his
warning<a name="FNanchor1310"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1310">[1310]</a>. This was, apparently, a complication
unforeseen at the Foreign Office. In any case Russell at once made
a complete face-about from the policy he had outlined in reply to
Lord Houghton. On May 30 he instructed Cowley in Paris to notify
France <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_267"></a>[V2:pg
267]</span> that England thought the time had arrived for
recognition that the war was ended and laid special stress upon the
question of Confederate cruisers still at sea and their proper
treatment in British ports<a name="FNanchor1311"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1311">[1311]</a>. Thus having given to France notice of
his intention, but without waiting for concurrent action, Russell,
on June 2, issued instructions to the Admiralty that the war was
ended and stated the lines upon which the Confederate cruisers were
to be treated<a name="FNanchor1312"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1312">[1312]</a>. Here was prompt, even hurried, action
though the only additional event of war in America which Russell
could at the moment cite to warrant his change of policy was the
capture of Jefferson Davis. On the same day Russell wrote to Bruce
stating what had been done and recognizing the "re-establishment of
peace within the whole territory of which the United States, before
the commencement of the civil war, were in undisturbed
possession<a name="FNanchor1313"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1313">[1313]</a>."</p>
<p>This sudden shift by the Government did not escape Derby's
caustic criticism. June 12, he referred in Parliament to Houghton's
previous inquiry and Russell's answer, asking why the Government
had not stuck to its earlier position and calling attention to the
fact that the United States, while now proclaiming certain ports
open to trade, yet specified others as still closed and threatened
with punishment as pirates, any vessel attempting to enter them.
Derby desired information as to what the Government had done about
this remarkable American proclamation. Russell, "who was very
imperfectly heard," answered that undoubtedly it was embarrassing
that no "regular communication" had been received from America
giving notice of the end of the war, but that the two Confederate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_268"></a>[V2:pg 268]</span>
cruisers still at sea and the entrance of one of them to various
Australian ports had compelled some British action. He had
consulted Adams, who had no instructions but felt confident the
United States would soon formally declare the end of the war. The
"piracy proclamation" was certainly a strange proceeding. Derby
pushed for an answer as to whether the Government intended to let
it go by unnoticed. Russell replied that a despatch from Bruce
showed that "notice" had been taken of it. Derby asked whether the
papers would be presented to Parliament; Russell "was understood to
reply in the affirmative<a name="FNanchor1314"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1314">[1314]</a>." Derby's inquiry was plainly merely a
hectoring of Russell for his quick shift from the position taken a
month earlier. But the very indifference of Russell to this attack,
his carelessness and evasion in reply, indicate confidence that
Parliament was as eager as the Government to satisfy the North and
to avoid friction. The only actual "notice" taken by Bruce at
Washington of the "piracy proclamation" was in fact, to report it
to Russell, commenting that it was "unintelligible" and probably a
mere attempt to frighten foreign ship-owners<a name=
"FNanchor1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315">[1315]</a>. Russell
instructed Bruce not to ask for an explanation since Galveston had
been captured subsequent to the date of the proclamation and there
was presumably no port left where it could be applied<a name=
"FNanchor1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316">[1316]</a>.</p>
<p>In truth the actual events of the closing days of the war had
outrun diplomatic action by America. Scattered Southern forces
still in the field surrendered with an unexpected rapidity, while
at Washington all was temporarily in confusion upon the death of
Lincoln and the illness of Seward. Bruce's advice had been wise and
the prompt action of Russell fortunate. Seward at once accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_269"></a>[V2:pg 269]</span>
Russell's notification of June 2 as ending British neutrality.
While again insisting upon the essential injustice of the original
concession of belligerent rights to the South, and objecting to
some details in the instructions to the Admiralty, he yet admitted
that normal relations were again established and acknowledged that
the United States could no longer exercise a right of
search<a name="FNanchor1317"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1317">[1317]</a>. July 4, Russell presented this paper
to Parliament, reading that portion in which Seward expressed his
pleasure that the United States could now enter again upon normal
relations with Great Britain<a name="FNanchor1318"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1318">[1318]</a>. Two days later Russell wrote to Bruce
that he had not expected Seward to acknowledge the rightfulness of
England's neutrality position, pointed out that his Admiralty
instructions were misunderstood and were less objectionable than
appeared and concluded by the expression of a hope for the
"establishment of a lasting and intimate friendship between the two
nations<a name="FNanchor1319"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1319">[1319]</a>."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Great Britain, wrote the Russian Minister in Washington in
January, 1860, was about to experience one of those "strokes of
fortune" which occurred but rarely in the history of nations, in
the approaching dissolution of the American Union. She alone, of
all the nations of the world, would benefit by it in the expansion
of her power, hitherto blocked by the might of the United States.
Broken into two or more hostile pieces America would be at the
mercy of England, to become her plaything. "The Cabinet of London
is watching attentively the internal dissensions of the Union and
awaits the result with an impatience which it has difficulty in
disguising." Great Britain would soon, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_270"></a>[V2:pg 270]</span> in return for
cotton, give recognition to the South and, if required, armed
support. For this same cotton she would oppose emancipation of the
slaves. The break-up of the Union was no less than a disaster for
all nations save England, since hitherto the "struggle" between
England and the United States "has been the best guarantee against
the ambitious projects and political egotism of the Anglo-Saxon
race<a name="FNanchor1320"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1320">[1320]</a>."</p>
<p>This prophecy, made over a year in advance of events, was
repeated frequently as the crisis in America approached and during
the first two years of the war. Stoeckl was not solitary in such
opinion. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs held it also--and
the French Emperor puzzled himself in vain to discover why Great
Britain, in furtherance of her own interests, did not eagerly
accept his overtures for a vigorous joint action in support of the
South<a name="FNanchor1321"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1321">[1321]</a>.</p>
<p>The preceding chapters of this work will have shown how
unfounded was such prophecy. Stoeckl was behind the times, knowing
nothing, apparently, of that positive change in British policy in
the late 'fifties which resulted in a determination to cease
opposition to the expansion of American power. Such opposition was
then acknowledged to have been an error and in its place there
sprang into being a conviction that the might of America would tend
toward the greatness of England itself<a name=
"FNanchor1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322">[1322]</a>. In the
months preceding the outbreak of the Civil War all British
governmental effort was directed toward keeping clear of the
quarrel and toward conciliation of the two sections. No doubt there
were those in Great Britain who rejoiced at the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_271"></a>[V2:pg 271]</span> rupture
between North and South, but they were not in office and had no
control of British policy.</p>
<p>The war once begun, the Government, anxious to keep clear of it,
was prompt in proclaiming neutrality and hastened this step for
fear of maritime complications with that one of the belligerents,
the North, which alone possessed a naval force. But the British
Ministry, like that of every other European state, believed that a
revolution for independence when undertaken by a people so numerous
and powerful as that of the South, must ultimately succeed. Hence
as the war dragged on, the Ministry, pressed from various angles at
home, ventured, with much uncertainty, upon a movement looking
toward mediation. Its desire was first of all for the restoration
of world peace, nor can any other motive be discovered in Russell's
manoeuvres. This attempt, fortunately for America and, it may be
believed, for the world, was blocked by cool heads within the
Ministry itself. There was quick and, as it proved, permanent
readjustment of policy to the earlier decision not to meddle in the
American crisis.</p>
<p>This very failure to meddle was cause of great complaint by both
North and South, each expectant, from divergent reasons, of British
sympathy and aid. The very anger of the North at British "cold
neutrality" is evidence of how little America, feeling the ties of
race and sentiment, could have understood the mistaken view-point
of diplomats like Stoeckl, who dwelt in realms of "reasons of
state," unaffected by popular emotions. Aside from race, which
could be claimed also by the South, the one great argument of the
North in appeal to England lay in the cry of anti-slavery. But the
leaders of the North denied its pertinence. Itself unsympathetic
with the emotions of emancipation societies at home, the British
Government settled down by the end of 1862 to a fixed policy of
strict neutrality.</p>
<p>In all this the Government but pursued that line which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_272"></a>[V2:pg 272]</span> is
the business of Governments--the preservation of the prosperity and
power of the state. With the unexpected prolongation of the war and
the British recognition of the Northern "will to conquer" there
came, as is evident from a scrutiny of Russell's diplomatic tone
and acts, a growing belief that the North might after all succeed
in its purpose, at least of subjugating the South. This would mean
the possibility of continuing that policy of friendship for a
united America which had been determined upon in the 'fifties. Here
was no special sympathy, but merely a cool calculation of benefits
to Great Britain, but there can be no question that the general
attitude of the Government by midsummer of 1863 was distinctly
favourable to a restored Union. A "friendly neutrality" began to
replace a "cold neutrality."</p>
<p>But it is the business of Governments not merely to guard
national interests and prosperity; they also must guard their own
authority and seek to remain in political power. Here emancipation,
never greatly stirring the leaders, whether Whig or Tory, exercised
an increasing pressure by the force of public approval. It made
impossible any attempt to overthrow the Ministry on the score of
non-interference in America, or of favouritism toward the North. It
gave to an enthusiastic and vociferous section of the British
public just ground for strong support of Lincoln and his cause, and
in some degree it affected governmental attitude.</p>
<p>There was, however, another question, much more vital than
emancipation in its relation to British home politics, that ran
like a constant thread through the whole pattern of British public
attitude toward America. It had always been so since the days of
the American revolution and now was accentuated by the American
war. This was the question of the future of democracy. Was its fate
bound up with the result of that war? And if so where lay British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_273"></a>[V2:pg 273]</span>
interest? Always present in the minds of thoughtful Englishmen,
appearing again and again through each changing phase of the war,
this question was so much a constant that to have attempted
discussion of it while other topics were being treated, would have
resulted in repetition and confusion. It is therefore made the
subject of a separate and concluding chapter.</p>

long-time resident in the United States, in which was outlined a
plan of a Russian offer of mediation. The memorandum specified that
such an offer should be based on the idea that the time had come
for a complete restoration of the Union and argued that both North
and South regarded Russia as a special friend; it was Russia's
interest to see the Union restored as a balance to Great Britain.
Gortchakoff's comment was favourable, but he left it wholly to
Stoeckl's judgment and discretion to act upon the plan. (Russian
Archives. F.O. to Stoeckl, Feb. 6, 1865.)</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE KEY-NOTE OF BRITISH ATTITUDE</h3>
<br>
<p>On May 8, 1865, the news was received in London of Johnston's
surrender to Sherman. On that same day there occurred in the
Commons the first serious debate in thirty-three years on a
proposed expansion of the electoral franchise. It was a dramatic
coincidence and no mere fortuitous one in the minds of thoughtful
Englishmen who had seen in the Civil War a struggle as fateful in
British domestic policy as in that of America herself. Throughout
all British political agitation from the time of the American
revolution in 1776, there had run the thread of the American
"example" as argument to some for imitation, to others for warning.
Nearly every British traveller in America, publishing his
impressions, felt compelled to report on American governmental and
political institutions, and did so from his preconceived notions of
what was desirable in his own country<a name=
"FNanchor1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323">[1323]</a>. In the ten
years immediately preceding the Civil War most travellers were
laudatory of American democracy, and one, the best in acute
analysis up to the time of Lord Bryce's great work, had much
influence on that class in England which was discontented with
existing political institutions at home. This was Mackay's
<i>Western World</i> which, first published in 1849, had gone
through four editions in 1850 and in succeeding years was
frequently reprinted<a name="FNanchor1324"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1324">[1324]</a>. Republicanism, Mackay asserted, was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_275"></a>[V2:pg 275]</span>
longer an experiment; its success and permanence were evident in
the mighty power of the United States; Canada would soon follow the
American example; the "injustice" of British aristocrats to the
United States was intentional, seeking to discredit democracy:</p>
<blockquote>"... Englishmen are too prone to mingle severity with
their judgments whenever the Republic is concerned. It is the
interest of aristocracy to exhibit republicanism, where-ever it is
found, in the worst possible light, and the mass of the people have
too long, by pandering to their prejudice, aided them in their
object. They recognize America as the stronghold of republicanism.
If they can bring it into disrepute here, they know that they
inflict upon it the deadliest blow in Europe<a name=
"FNanchor1325"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1325">[1325]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On the opposing side were other writers. Tremenheere argued the
inapplicability of American institutions to Great Britain<a name=
"FNanchor1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326">[1326]</a>. The
theoretical bases of those institutions were in some respects
admirable but in actual practice they had resulted in the rule of
the mob and had debased the nation in the estimation of the world;
bribery in elections, the low order of men in politics and in
Congress, were proofs of the evils of democracy; those in England
who clamoured for a "numerical" rather than a class representation
should take warning from the American experiment. Occasionally,
though rarely, there appeared the impressions of some British
traveller who had no political axe to grind<a name=
"FNanchor1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327">[1327]</a>, but from
1850 to 1860, as in every previous decade, British writing on
America was coloured by the author's attitude on <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_276"></a>[V2:pg 276]</span> political
institutions at home. The "example" of America was constantly on
the horizon in British politics.</p>
<p>In 1860, the Liberal movement in England was at its lowest ebb
since the high tide of 1832. Palmerston was generally believed to
have made a private agreement with Derby that both Whig and Tory
parties would oppose any movement toward an expansion of the
franchise<a name="FNanchor1328"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1328">[1328]</a>. Lord John Russell, in his youth an
eager supporter of the Reform Bill of 1832, had now gained the name
of "Finality John" by his assertion that that Reform was final in
British institutions. Political reaction was in full swing much to
the discontent of Radicals like Bright and Cobden and their
supporters. When the storm broke in America the personal
characteristics of the two leaders North and South, Lincoln and
Davis, took on, to many British eyes, an altogether extreme
importance as if representative of the political philosophies of
the two sections. Lincoln's "crudity" was democratic; Davis'
"culture" was aristocratic--nor is it to be denied that Davis had
"aristocratic" views on government<a name=
"FNanchor1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329">[1329]</a>. But that
this issue had any vital bearing on the quarrel between the
American sections was never generally voiced in England. Rather,
British comment was directed to the lesson, taught to the world by
the American crisis, of the failure of democratic institutions in
<i>national power.</i> Bright had long preached to the
unenfranchised of England the prosperity and might of America and
these had long been denied by the aristocratic faction to be a
result of democratic institutions. At first the denial was now
repeated, the <i>Saturday Review</i>, February 23, 1861, protesting
that there was no essential connection between the "shipwreck" of
American institutions and the movement in England for an expanded
franchise. Even, the article <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_277"></a>[V2:pg 277]</span> continued, if an attempt were
made to show such a connection it would convince nobody since "Mr.
Bright has succeeded in persuading a great number of influential
persons that the admission of working-men into the constituencies
is chiefly, if not solely, desirable on the ground that it has
succeeded admirably in America and has proved a sovereign panacea
against the war, taxation and confusion which are the curses of old
Governments in Europe." Yet that the denial was not sincere is
shown by the further assertion that "the shallow demagogues of
Birmingham and other kindred platforms must bear the blame of the
inference, drawn nearly universally at the present moment, that, if
the United States become involved in hopeless difficulties, it
would be madness to lower the qualification for the suffrage in
England."</p>
<p>This pretended disclaimer of any essential relation between the
American struggle and British institutions was not long persisted
in. A month later the <i>Saturday Review</i> was strong in
contemptuous criticism of the "promiscuous democracy" of the
North<a name="FNanchor1330"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1330">[1330]</a>. Less political journals followed suit.
The <i>Economist</i> thought the people of England would now be
convinced of the folly of aping America and that those who had
advocated universal suffrage would be filled with "mingled alarm,
gratitude and shame<a name="FNanchor1331"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1331">[1331]</a>." Soon W.H. Russell could write, while
still at Washington "... the world will only see in it all, the
failure of republican institutions in time of pressure as
demonstrated by all history--that history which America vainly
thought she was going to set right and re-establish on new grounds
and principles<a name="FNanchor1332"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1332">[1332]</a>." "The English worshippers of American
institutions," said the <i>Saturday Review</i>, "are in danger of
losing their last pretext for preferring <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_278"></a>[V2:pg 278]</span> the Republic
to the obsolete and tyrannical Monarchy of England.... It now
appears that the peaceable completion of the secession has become
impossible, and it will be necessary to discover some new ground of
superiority by which Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Lincoln may be
advantageously contrasted with Queen Victoria<a name=
"FNanchor1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333">[1333]</a>."</p>
<p>These expressions antedated the news of the actual opening of
the war and may be regarded as jeers at Bright and his followers
rather than as attempts to read a lesson to the public. No such
expressions are to be found in the letters of leading officials
though minor ones occasionally indulged in them<a name=
"FNanchor1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334">[1334]</a>. As late as
June, 1861, Adams declared that while some in England welcomed
American disunion as a warning to their countrymen it was evident
that but a small number as yet saw the cause of the North as
identical with the world progress of free institutions<a name=
"FNanchor1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335">[1335]</a>. Evidently
he was disappointed that the followers of Bright were not
exhibiting more courage and demanding public support of the North
as fighting their battle at home. They were indeed strangely
silent, depressed no doubt by American events, and discouraged. It
required time also to arouse intensity of feeling on the American
question and to see clearly the issues involved. Aristocratic
Britain was first to declare a definite lesson to be learned,
thereby bringing out the fighting qualities of British democracy.
Throughout 1861, the comment was relatively mild. In July,
<i>Blackwood's</i> declared:</p>
<blockquote>"It is precisely because we do not share the admiration
of America for her own institutions and political tendencies that
we do not now see in the impending change an event <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_279"></a>[V2:pg 279]</span> altogether to
be deplored. In those institutions and tendencies we saw what our
own might be if the most dangerous elements of our Constitution
should become dominant. We saw democracy rampant, with no
restriction upon its caprices. We saw a policy which received its
impulses always from below ... nor need we affect particularly to
lament the exhibition of the weak point of a Constitution ... the
disruption of which leaves entirely untouched the laws and usages
which America owes to England, and which have contributed so
powerfully to her prosperity...."<br>
<br>
"With a rival Government on the frontier ... with great principles
to be not vapoured about but put to the proof we should probably
see the natural aristocracy rise from the dead level of the
Republic, raising the national character with its own
elevation<a name="FNanchor1336"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1336">[1336]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>In the same month the <i>Quarterly</i>, always more calm,
logical and convincing than <i>Blackwood's</i>, published
"Democracy on its Trial<a name="FNanchor1337"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1337">[1337]</a>." "The example of America kept alive,
as it had created, the party of progress"; now "it has sunk from
the decrepitude of premature old age." If England, after such an
example, permits herself to be led into democracy she "will have
perished by that wilful infatuation which no warning can
dispel."</p>
<p>Adams had complained that few British friends of progress
identified the cause of the North with their own, but this was true
of Americans also. The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for July 1861,
discussed British attitude wholly in terms of cotton supply. But
soon there appeared in the British press so many preachments on the
"lesson" of America that the aristocratic effort to gain an
advantage at home became apparent to all<a name=
"FNanchor1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338">[1338]</a>. The
<i>Economist</i> moralized on the "untried" <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_280"></a>[V2:pg 280]</span> character of
American institutions and statesmen, the latter usually as ignorant
as the "masses" whom they represented and if more intellectual
still more worthy of contempt because of their "voluntary moral
degradation" to the level of their constituents<a name=
"FNanchor1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339">[1339]</a>. "The upper
and ruling class" wrote Bright to Sumner, were observing with
satisfaction, "that democracy may get into trouble, and war, and
debt, and taxes, as aristocracy has done for this country<a name=
"FNanchor1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340">[1340]</a>." Thus
Bright could not deny the blow to democracy; nor could the
<i>Spectator</i>, upbraiding its countrymen for lack of sympathy
with the North: "New England will be justified in saying that Old
England's anti-slavery sympathies are mere hollow sentimental
pretences, since she can rest satisfied to stuff her ears with
cotton against the cries of the slaves, and to compensate her
gentle regret over the new impulse given to slavery by her lively
gratification over the paralyzing shock suffered by
Democracy<a name="FNanchor1341"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1341">[1341]</a>." This was no taking up of cudgels for
the North and "Progress" such as Adams had hoped for. Vigour rested
with the opposing side and increased when hopes of a short war
vanished. The <i>Saturday Review</i> asserted:</p>
<blockquote>"In that reconstruction of political philosophy which
the American calamities are likely to inaugurate, the value of the
popular element will be reduced to its due proportions.... The true
guarantee of freedom will be looked for more in the equilibrium of
classes than in the equality of individuals.... We may hope, at
last, that the delusive confusion between freedom and democracy is
finally banished from the minds of Englishmen<a name=
"FNanchor1342"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1342">[1342]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>"The real secret," wrote Motley, "of the exultation which
manifests itself in the <i>Times</i> and other organs over our
troubles and disasters, is their hatred, not to America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_281"></a>[V2:pg 281]</span> so
much as to democracy in England<a name="FNanchor1343"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1343">[1343]</a>." It was scarcely a secret in the
columns of the journals already quoted. But no similar
interpretation had as yet appeared in the <i>Times</i> and Motley's
implication was justified for it and other leading daily
newspapers. The Reviews and Weeklies were for the moment leading
the attack--possibly one reason for the slowness in reply of Bright
and his followers. Not all Reviews joined in the usual analysis.
The <i>Edinburgh</i> at first saw in slavery the sole cause of the
American dispute<a name="FNanchor1344"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1344">[1344]</a>, then attributed it to the inevitable
failure in power of a federal system of government, not mentioning
democracy as in question<a name="FNanchor1345"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1345">[1345]</a>. <i>Blackwood's</i> repeatedly pushed
home its argument:</p>
<blockquote>"Independent of motives of humanity, we are glad that
the end of the Union seems more likely to be ridiculous than
terrible.... But for our own benefit and the instruction of the
world we wish to see the faults, so specious and so fatal, of their
political system exposed, in the most effective way.... And the
venerable Lincoln, the respectable Seward, the raving editors, the

malicious tricks of fortune played off on an unwary nation, but are
all of them the legitimate offspring of the great Republic ...
dandled and nursed--one might say coddled--by Fortune, the spoiled

become reconciled to the much slighter amount of suffering that war
inflicts on America<a name="FNanchor1346"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1346">[1346]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Equally outspoken were a few public men who early espoused the
cause of the South. Beresford Hope, before a "distinguished
audience" used language insulting to the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_282"></a>[V2:pg 282]</span> North, fawning
upon the South and picturing the latter as wholly admirable for its
aristocratic tendencies. For this he was sharply taken to task by
the <i>Spectator</i><a name="FNanchor1347"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1347">[1347]</a>. More sedately the Earl of Shrewsbury
proclaimed, "I see in America the trial of Democracy and its
failure. I believe that the dissolution of the Union is inevitable,
and that men now before me will live to see an aristocracy
established in America<a name="FNanchor1348"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1348">[1348]</a>." In all countries and at all times
there are men over-eager in early prophecy on current events, but
in such utterances as these there is manifest not merely the
customary desire to stand in the limelight of assured knowledge and
wisdom, but also the happy conviction that events in America were
working to the undoing of the Radicals of Great Britain. If they
would not be supine the Radicals must strike back. On December 4,
at Rochdale where, as the <i>Times</i> asserted, he was sure of an
audience sympathetic on purely personal grounds, Bright renewed his
profession of faith in the American Republic and sang his
accustomed praises of its great accomplishments<a name=
"FNanchor1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349">[1349]</a>. The battle,
for England, on American democracy, was joined; the challenge
issued by aristocratic England, accepted.</p>
<p>But apart from extreme factions at either end of the scale there
stood a group holding a middle ground opinion, not yet sure of the
historical significance of the American collapse. To this group
belonged Gladstone, as yet uncertain of his political philosophy,
and regretful, though vainly, it would appear, of the blow to
democracy. He wrote his thought to Brougham, no doubt hoping to
influence the view-point of the <i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<blockquote>"This has without doubt been a deplorable year for poor
'Democracy' and never has the old woman been at a heavier discount
since 1793. I see no discredit to the founders of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_283"></a>[V2:pg 283]</span> American
constitution in the main fact of the rupture. On the contrary it
was a great achievement to strike off by the will and wit of man a
constitution for two millions of men scattered along a seaboard,
which has lasted until they have become more than thirty millions
and have covered a whole continent. But the freaks, pranks, and
follies, not to say worse, with which the rupture has been met in
the Northern States, down to Mr. Chase's financial (not exposition
but) exposure have really given as I have said the old lady in
question such a heavy blow and great discouragement that I hope you
will in the first vigour of your action be a little merciful and
human lest you murder her outright<a name=
"FNanchor1350"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1350">[1350]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>On this middle group of Englishmen and their moral conceptions
the American Minister, Adams, at first pinned his faith, not
believing in 1861 that the issues of democracy or of trade
advantage would lead Great Britain from just rules of conduct. Even
in the crisis of the <i>Trent</i> affair he was firm in this
opinion:</p>
<blockquote>"Much as the commercial and manufacturing interests may
be disposed to view the tariff as the source of all our evils, and
much as the aristocratic classes may endeavour to make democracy
responsible for them, the inexorable logic of events is
contradicting each and every assertion based on these notions, and
proving that the American struggle is, after all, the
ever-recurring one in human affairs between right and wrong,
between labour and capital, between liberty and absolutism. When
such an issue comes to be presented to the people of Great Britain,
stripped of all the disguises which have been thrown over it, it is
not difficult to predict at least which side it will <i>not</i>
consent to take<a name="FNanchor1351"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1351">[1351]</a>.</blockquote>
<p>April, 1861, saw the beginning of the aristocratic challenge on
American democracy and December its acceptance by Bright.
Throughout 1862 he practically deserted his seat in Parliament and
devoted himself to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_284"></a>[V2:pg 284]</span> stirring up labour and radical
sentiment in favour of the North. In January, 1862, a mass meeting
at New Hall, Edgware Road, denounced the daily press and was
thought of sufficient moment to be reported by Adams. A motion was
carried:</p>
<blockquote>"That in the opinion of this meeting, considering the
ill-disguised efforts of the <i>Times</i> and other misleading
journals to misrepresent public opinion here on all American
questions ... to decry democratic institutions under the trials to
which the Republic is exposed, it is the duty of the working-men
especially as unrepresented in the National Senate to express their
sympathy with the United States in their gigantic struggle for the
preservation of the Union<a name="FNanchor1352"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1352">[1352]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>The daily press was, in fact, now joining more openly in the
controversy. The <i>Morning Post</i>, stating with conviction its
belief that there could be no re-union in America, added:</p>
<blockquote>"... if the Government of the United States should
succeed in reannexing them [the Southern States] to its still
extensive dominions, Democracy will have achieved its grandest
triumph since the world began. It will have demonstrated to the
ample satisfaction of its present and future proselytes that it is
even more puissant in war than in peace; that it can navigate not
only the smooth seas of unendangered prosperity, but can ride
safely through the fiercest tempests that would engulf every other
craft laden with human destinies; that it can descend to the
darkest depths of adversity, and rise from them all the stronger
for the descent.... And who can doubt that Democracy will be more
arrogant, more aggressive, more levelling and vulgarizing, if that
be possible, than it ever had been before<a name=
"FNanchor1353"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1353">[1353]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>By midsummer, 1862, Adams was more convinced than in 1861 that
the political controversy in England had an important bearing on
the attitude toward America. Even the alleged neutrality of
<i>Fraser's Magazine</i> seemed turning <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_285"></a>[V2:pg 285]</span> to one-sided
presentation of the "lesson" of America. Mill's defence of the
North, appearing in the February number, was soon followed in July
by the first of a series of articles, "Universal Suffrage in the
United States and Its Consequences," depicting the war as the
result of mob rule and predicting a military despotism as its
inevitable consequence. The Liberals were losing strength, wrote
Adams:</p>
<blockquote>"That the American difficulties have materially
contributed to this result cannot be doubted. The fact that many of
the leading Liberals are the declared friends of the United States
is a decided disadvantage in the contest now going on. The
predominating passion here is the desire for the ultimate
subdivision of America into many separate States which will
neutralize each other. This is most visible among the conservative
class of the Aristocracy who dread the growth of liberal opinions
and who habitually regard America as the nursery of them<a name=
"FNanchor1354"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1354">[1354]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>From all this controversy Government leaders kept carefully
aloof at least in public expression of opinion. Privately, Russell
commented to Palmerston, "I have been reading a book on Jefferson
by De Witt, which is both interesting and instructive. It shows how
the Great Republic of Washington degenerated into the Democracy of
Jefferson. They are now reaping the fruit<a name=
"FNanchor1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355">[1355]</a>." Was it
mere coincidence or was there significance in an editorial in
Palmerston's alleged "organ," the <i>Morning Post</i>:</p>
<blockquote>"That any Englishman has looked forward with pleasure
to the calamities of America is notoriously and demonstrably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_286"></a>[V2:pg 286]</span>
false. But we have no hesitation in admitting that many thoughtful
Englishmen who have watched, in the policy of the United States
during the last twenty years, the foreshadowing of a democratic
tyranny compared with which the most corrupt despotisms of the Old
World appear realms of idyllic happiness and peace, have gratefully
recognized the finger of Providence in the strife by which they
have been so frightfully rent asunder<a name=
"FNanchor1356"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1356">[1356]</a>...."</blockquote>
<p>In October the heavy artillery of the Conservatives was again
brought into action and this time with more explicit diagnosis than
heretofore. "For a great number of years," said the
<i>Quarterly</i>, "a certain party among us, great admirers of
America ... have chosen to fight their English battles upon
American soil." Now the American Government "has disgracefully and
ignominiously failed" at all points. It is evident that "political
equality is not merely a folly, it is a chimera<a name=
"FNanchor1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357">[1357]</a>." At last,
in November, the <i>Times</i> openly took the position which its
accusers declared to have been the basis of its editorial
utterances almost from the beginning of the Civil War.</p>
<blockquote>"These are the consequences of a cheap and simple form
of government, having a rural attorney for Sovereign and a city
attorney for Prime Minister. We have already said that if such a
terrible exposure of incapacity had happened in England we should
at the earliest moment possible have sent the incapables about
their business, and put ourselves in the hands of better
men...."<br>
<br>
"This Republic has been so often proposed to us as a model for
imitation that we should be unpardonable not to mark how it works
now, when for the first time it has some work to do. We believe
that if the English system of Parliamentary action had existed in
America, the war could not have occurred, but we are quite sure
that such Ministers would have long since been changed<a name=
"FNanchor1358"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1358">[1358]</a>."</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_287"></a>[V2:pg 287]</span>
<p>In addition to a Conservative ringing the changes upon the
failure of democracy, the open friends of the South dilated also
upon the "gentlemanly" characteristics of Southern leaders and
society. This was the frequent burden of articles in <i>The
Index</i> in the early weeks of its publication. To this was soon
added a picture of Northern democracy as composed of and controlled
by the "immigrant element" which was the source of "the enormous
increase of population in the last thirty years" from revolutionary
areas in Europe. "Germans, Hungarians, Irish carried with them more
than their strong arms, they imported also their theories of
equality.... The revolutionary party which represents them is at
this moment master in the States of the North, where it is
indulging in all its customary licence<a name=
"FNanchor1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359">[1359]</a>." This fact,
complained <i>The Index</i>, was not sufficiently brought out in
the English press. Very different was the picture painted by
Anthony Trollope after a tour of the Western states:</p>
<blockquote>"... this man has his romance, his high poetic feeling,
and above all his manly dignity. Visit him, and you will find him
without coat or waistcoat, unshorn, in ragged blue trousers and old
flannel shirt, too often bearing on his lantern jaws the signs of
ague and sickness; but he will stand upright before you and speak
to you with all the ease of a lettered gentleman in his own
library. All the odious incivility of the republican servant has
been banished. He is his own master, standing on his own threshold,
and finds no need to assert his equality by rudeness. He is
delighted to see you, and bids you sit down on his battered bench,
without dreaming of any such apology as an English cotter offers to
a Lady Bountiful when she calls. He has worked out his
independence, and shows it in every easy movement of his body. He
tells you of it unconsciously in every tone of his voice. You will
always find in his cabin some newspaper, some book, some token of
advance in education. When he questions you about the old country
he astonishes you by the extent of his knowledge. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_288"></a>[V2:pg 288]</span> I defy you not
to feel that he is superior to the race from whence he has sprung
in England or in Ireland."<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
"It is always the same story. With us there is no level of society.
Men stand on a long staircase, but the crowd congregates near the
bottom, and the lower steps are very broad. In America men stand
upon a common platform, but the platform is raised above the
ground, though it does not approach in height the top of our
staircase. If we take the average altitude in the two countries, we
shall find that the American heads are the more elevated of the
two<a name="FNanchor1360"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1360">[1360]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>A comparison of dates shows that the unanimity of conservative
and aristocratic expression on the failure of American democracy
and its lesson to England was most marked and most open at the
moment when the Government was seriously considering an offer of
mediation in the war. Meanwhile the emancipation proclamation of
September, 1862, had appeared. It did not immediately affect
governmental attitude, save adversely to the North, and it gave a
handle for pro-Southern outcry on the score of a "servile war."
Indeed, the radicals were at first depressed by it; but when months
passed with no appearance of a servile war and when the second
emancipation proclamation of January, 1863, further certified the
moral purpose of the North, a great element of strength was added
to the English advocates of democracy. The numerous "addresses" to
Lincoln exhibited both a revived moral enthusiasm for the cause of
anti-slavery and were frequently combined with a laudation of
American political institutions. The great mass-meeting at Exeter
Hall, January 29, 1863, was described by the correspondent of an
American paper as largely deriving its strength from the universal
dissatisfaction <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_289"></a>[V2:pg 289]</span> of the lower orders of the
English people with their existing conditions under the Crown:</p>
<blockquote>"The descendants of the Roundhead commoners, chafing
under the limitations of the franchise, burdensome taxation, the
contempt with which they are regarded by the lords of the soil, the
grievous effects of the laws of entail and primogeniture, whereby
they are kept poor and rendered liable to starvation and
pauperism--these have looked to America as the model democracy
which proves the poor man's capacity for self-government." The
meeting was called for seven o'clock but at half after five the
hall was filled, and at six crowded. A second hall was filled and
outdoor meetings of two thousand people organized in Exeter Street.
"All working-class England was up in arms, not so much against
slavery as against British oligarchy<a name=
"FNanchor1361"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1361">[1361]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The correspondent further reported rumours that this meeting had
caused anxious consideration to the managers of the <i>Times</i>,
and the decision to step more warily. No doubt this was
exaggeration of the political character and effect of the meeting,
but certain it is that the political element was present joining
hands with anti-slavery enthusiasm. Also it is noteworthy that the
last confident and vigorous expression of the "failure" of
democracy, from sources professedly neutral, appeared immediately
after the St. James' Hall meeting, but was necessarily written
before that meeting took place. <i>Blackwood's</i>, in its issue of
February, 1863, declared, as before: "Every sensible man in this
country now acknowledges ... that we have already gone as far
toward democracy as is safe to go.... This is the great moral
benefit which we have derived from the events in America." John
Blackwood was an intimate friend of Delane, editor of the
<i>Times</i>, holding similar views on political questions; but the
<i>Times</i> was suddenly grown cautious in reading English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_290"></a>[V2:pg 290]</span>
political lessons from America. In truth, attack now rested with
the Radicals and Bright's oratory was in great demand<a name=
"FNanchor1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362">[1362]</a>. He now
advanced from the defensive position of laudation of the North to
the offensive one of attacking the Southern aristocracy, not merely
because it wished to perpetuate African slavery, but because it
desired to make all the working-classes as subservient to it as was
the negro<a name="FNanchor1363"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1363">[1363]</a>. It was now Radical purpose to keep the
battle raging and they were succeeding. Bigelow believed that the
United States might well recognize its opportunity in this
controversy and give aid to its friends:</p>
<blockquote>"After all, this struggle of ours both at home and
abroad is but a struggle between the principle of popular
government and government by a privileged class. The people
therefore all the world over are in a species of solidarity which
it is our duty and interest to cultivate to the utmost<a name=
"FNanchor1364"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1364">[1364]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But Adams gave contrary advice. Wholly sympathetic with the
democratic movement in England as now, somewhat to his surprise,
developed, he yet feared that the extremes to which Bright and
others were going in support of the North might create unfortunate
reactions in the Government. Especially he was anxious that the
United States should not offer opportunity for accusation of
interference in a British political quarrel. It is noteworthy that
while many addresses to Lincoln were forwarded by him and many were
printed in the annual publication of diplomatic correspondence,
those that thus appeared dealt almost exclusively with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_291"></a>[V2:pg 291]</span> emancipation.
Yet Adams was also forwarding addresses and speeches harping on
American democracy. A meeting at Edinburgh, February 19, found
place, in its emancipation aspect in the United States
documents<a name="FNanchor1365"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1365">[1365]</a>, but the burden of that meeting,
democracy, did not. It was there proclaimed that the British press
misrepresented conditions in America, "because the future of free
political institutions, as sketched in the American Declaration of
Independence and in the State Constitutions of the Northern States,
would be a standing argument against the expansion of the franchise
and the enjoyment of just political rights among us, as well as a
convenient argument in favour of the continued domination of our
aristocratic parties<a name="FNanchor1366"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1366">[1366]</a>." The tide of democratic feeling was
rising rapidly in England. On March 26, Adams wrote to Seward of a
recent debate in Parliament that that body was much more judicious
in expressions on America than it had been before 1862. "It will
not escape your observation that the question is now felt to be
taking a shape which was scarcely anticipated by the managers [of
the <i>Times</i>] when they first undertook to guide the British
mind to the overthrow of free institutions in America<a name=
"FNanchor1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367">[1367]</a>."</p>
<p>On the evening of the day on which this was written there
occurred the greatest, most outspoken, and most denunciatory to the
aristocracy, of the meetings held to support the cause of the
North. This was the spectacular gathering of the Trades Unions of
London at St. James' Hall, on March 26, usually regarded as the
culminating effort in Bright's tour of England for the cause of
democracy, but whose origin is somewhat shrouded in mystery.
Socialist tradition claims that Karl Marx conceived the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_292"></a>[V2:pg 292]</span> of
the meeting and was responsible for its organization<a name=
"FNanchor1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368">[1368]</a>. The press
generally reported it as a "Bright Meeting." Adams wrote to Seward
of the pressure put on him by Professor Beesly, of the University
of London, to send a representative from the American Ministry,
Beesly expanding upon the importance and high standing of the
Trades Unions. To this Adams demurred but finally sent his son to
sit in the audience and report the proceedings.</p>
<p>Whatever its origin there can be no doubt that this was the most
important of all pro-Northern meetings held in England during the
Civil War, nor that its keynote was "America fighting the battle of
democracy." Save for some distinguished speakers those in
attendance consisted almost wholly of three thousand picked
representatives of the Trades Unions of London. Adams transmitted
to Seward his son's report of the meeting, its character,
composition, names of speakers and their emphatic expressions of
friendship for the North<a name="FNanchor1369"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1369">[1369]</a>, but it is again noteworthy that Henry
Adams' clear analysis of the real significance of the meeting was
not printed in the published diplomatic correspondence. Giving due
praise to the speeches of Bright and Beesly, and commenting on
press assertions that "the extraordinary numbers there were only
brought together by their curiosity to hear Mr. Bright," Henry
Adams continued: "That this was not the case <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_293"></a>[V2:pg 293]</span> must have been
evident to every person present. In fact, it was only after he
closed that the real business of the evening began." Then followed
speeches and the introduction of resolutions by "Mr. Howell, a
bricklayer ... Mr. Odgers, a shoemaker ... Mr. Mantz, a compositor
... Mr. Cremer, a joiner, who was bitter against Lord Palmerston
... Mr. Conolly, a mason...." and other labouring men, all
asserting "that the success of free institutions in America was a
political question of deep consequence in England and that they
would not tolerate any interference unfavourable to the North." No
one, the report emphasized, "could doubt what was intended."</p>
<blockquote>"The meeting was a demonstration of democratic strength
and no concealment of this fact was made. If it did not have a
direct political bearing on internal politics in England it needed
little of doing so. There was not even a profession of faith in the
government of England as at present constituted. Every hostile
allusion to the Aristocracy, the Church, the opinions of the
'privileged classes,' was received with warm cheers. Every allusion
to the republican institutions of America, the right of suffrage,
the right of self-taxation, the 'sunlight' of republican influence,
was caught up by the audience with vehement applause. It may
therefore be considered as fairly and authoritatively announced
that the class of skilled workmen in London--that is the leaders of
the pure popular movement in England--have announced by an act
almost without precedent in their history, the principle that they
make common cause with the Americans who are struggling for the
restoration of the Union and that all their power and influence
shall be used on behalf of the North<a name=
"FNanchor1370"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1370">[1370]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Bright's words of most scarifying indictment of "Privilege," and
his appeal to workers to join hands with their fellows in America
have been given in a previous <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_294"></a>[V2:pg 294]</span> chapter<a name=
"FNanchor1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371">[1371]</a>. Evidently
that appeal, though enthusiastically received for its oratorical
brilliance, was unneeded. His was but an eloquent expression of
that which was in the minds of his audience. Upon the American
Minister the effect was to cause him to renew warnings against
showing too keen an appreciation of the support of political
radicalism in England. The meeting, he wrote, had at once stirred
anxiety in Parliament and verged:</p>
<blockquote>"... much too closely upon the minatory in the domestic
politics of this Kingdom to make it easy to recognize or sympathize
with by Foreign Governments.... Hence it seems to me of the
greatest consequence that the treatment of all present questions
between the two nations should be regulated by a provident forecast
of what may follow it [the political struggle in England]
hereafter. I am not sure that some parties here would not now be
willing even to take the risk of a war in order the more
effectually to turn the scale against us, and thus, as they think,
to crush the rising spirit of their own population. That this is
only a feeling at present and has not yet risen to the dignity of a
policy may be true enough; but that does not the less impose upon
the Government at home a duty so to shape its actions as, if
possible, to defeat all such calculations and dissipate such
hopes.... We owe this duty not less to the great body of those who
in this kingdom are friends to us and our institutions, than to
ourselves<a name="FNanchor1372"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1372">[1372]</a>."</blockquote>

<b>JOHN BRIGHT</b><br>
(<i>From a photograph taken of him in the attitude in which he
usually spoke</i>)<br>
(<i>From Trevelyan's "Life of John Bright</i>")</p>
<br>
<p>Thus Adams advised his Government to tread lightly in respect to
democratic agitation in England. Over a month later he received a
deputation headed by Bright, come to present to him the resolutions
passed at the Trades Unions' meeting. The deputation expressed
fears that a rupture was imminent in the relations of Great Britain
and America, and that this would have a disastrous influence on the
aspirations of working-class Europe. Adams replied in general terms
of appreciation for the sympathies expressed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_295"></a>[V2:pg 295]</span> by the meeting
but carefully avoided specific comment on its democratic purpose.
"He was too prudent," said the <i>Times</i> in reporting the
deputation, "to appraise the importance of the particular
demonstration to which his notice was invited ..." and his reply
was given favourable comment<a name="FNanchor1373"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1373">[1373]</a>. This reply, wrote Adams, "appears to
have had a sedative effect<a name="FNanchor1374"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1374">[1374]</a>." Meanwhile, Bright continued his
preachment to the English people though modifying his tone of
fierce accusation against "privilege," and confining himself to
declaring the interest of the unenfranchised in the American
conflict. In a speech before the Union and Emancipation Society of
London, on June 16, he asserted for the "twenty millions of people
in this country" as yet without representation in Parliament, "I
say that these have an interest, almost as great and direct as
though they were living in Massachusetts or New York, in the
tremendous struggle for freedom which is now shaking the whole
North American Continent<a name="FNanchor1375"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1375">[1375]</a>." Like utterances were repeated at
further public meetings and so insistent were they as to require
reply by the conservative faction, even if, as was supposed, the
effect of the Trades' Union attitude had been to give a halt to the
vehemence of those who had been sounding the "lesson" of American
failure in democracy. Bright became the centre of attack. The
<i>Times</i> led.</p>
<blockquote>"His is a political fanaticism. He used to idolize the
Constitution of the United States as the one great dominant
Democracy of the world. He believes in it still, and, if it must
go, he is ready to idolize its memory. For this he gives up all his
most cherished notions and all his less absorbing
principles...."<br>
<br>
"Yet Mr. Bright is consistent. He has one master passion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_296"></a>[V2:pg 296]</span>
and his breast, capacious as it is, can hold no more. That master
passion is the love of that great dominant Democracy. He worshipped
it while rising to its culminating point, and he is obliged to turn
right round to worship it while setting. He did not himself know,
until tested by this great trial, how entirely his opinions as to
war and peace, and slavery and freedom, and lust of conquest and
hatred of oppression, were all the mere accidents which hung
loosely upon him, and were capable of being detached at once in the
interest of the ruling passion of his soul for that great dominant
Democracy. Nor need we wonder; for if that great Democracy has been
a failure, then men will say that the life of Mr. John Bright up to
this time has been but a foolish dream<a name=
"FNanchor1376"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1376">[1376]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Evidently Bright's speeches were causing anxiety and bitterness;
but an "if" had crept into the estimate of the future of American
democracy, caused less by the progress of the war than by the
rising excitement of democratic England. The <i>Times</i> editorial
just quoted appeared when the faith was generally professed that
Lee was about to end the war through the invasion of Pennsylvania.
In the reaction created by the arrival of the news of Gettysburg
and Vicksburg, Adams still again warned his Government against
either a belligerent or interfering attitude toward Great Britain,
but stated plainly that Northern victory was of supreme importance
in Europe itself. "We have a mission to fulfill. It is to show, by
our example to the people of England in particular, and to all
nations in general, the value of republican institutions." There
was still a general belief in the incompetency of those
institutions. "The greatest triumph of all would be to prove these
calculations vain. In comparison with this, what would be the gain
to be derived from any collision with the powers of Europe<a name=
"FNanchor1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377">[1377]</a>?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_297"></a>[V2:pg 297]</span>
<p>It is strange that with so clearly-expressed a division of
English opinion on American democracy few in America itself
appreciated the significance of the British controversy. J.M.
Forbes, who had been on a special mission to England, wrote to
Lincoln, on his return<a name="FNanchor1378"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1378">[1378]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Our friends abroad see it! John Bright and his
glorious band of English Republicans see that we are fighting for
Democracy or (to get rid of the technical name) for liberal
institutions; the Democrats and the liberals of the old world are
as much and as heartily with us as any supporters we have on this
side.<br>
<br>
Our enemies too see it in the same light; the Aristocrats and the
Despots of the old world see that our quarrel is that of the People
against an Aristocracy<a name="FNanchor1379"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1379">[1379]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>But there are few similar expressions and these few nearly
always came from men who had been abroad and had thus come into
direct contact with British political movements. Meanwhile, Lee's
retreat from Pennsylvania had produced a like retreat in the
opinions on the failure of democracy earlier confidently held by
the professedly neutral press. In September, having arrived at the
point by the usual process of gradually facing about, the
<i>Times</i> was bold enough to deny that England had any personal
feeling or concern about democracy in America or that this had
anything to do with English attitude on the war<a name=
"FNanchor1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380">[1380]</a>. Thenceforth
neither the <i>Times</i> nor any of the leading papers saw fit to
revive with vigour the cry of "democracy's failure," no matter how
persistent in proclaiming ultimate victory for the South.
Aristocratic exultation had given place to alarm and it seemed
wiser, if possible, to quiet the issue<a name=
"FNanchor1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381">[1381]</a>. Not so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_298"></a>[V2:pg 298]</span>
Radicals, who made every effort to keep the issue alive in the
minds of the British public, and whose leaders with less violence
but increased firmness debated the question in every public meeting
favourable to the North<a name="FNanchor1382"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1382">[1382]</a>. Many Conservatives, Adams reported,
were now anxiously sitting on the fence yet finding the posture a
difficult one because of their irritation at Bright's
taunts<a name="FNanchor1383"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1383">[1383]</a>. Bright's star was rising. "The very
moment the war comes to an end," wrote Adams, "and a restoration of
the Union follows, it will be the signal for a reaction that will
make Mr. Bright perhaps the most formidable public man in
England<a name="FNanchor1384"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1384">[1384]</a>."</p>
<p>The continuation of the controversy was not, however, wholly
one-sided. In the silence of the daily press it seemed incumbent
upon the more eager and professed friends of the South to take up
the cudgels. Hence, in part, came the organization of the Southern
Independence Association and the attempt to hold public meetings
favourable to the South, in the early months of 1864. Much talk had
been spent on the "British issue" involved in the war; there was
now to be vigorous work to secure it<a name=
"FNanchor1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385">[1385]</a>. <i>The
Index</i> plunged into vigorous denunciation of "The Manchester
School, which, for convenience and truth, we had better for the
future call the American School." Even the Government was attacked
for its complacence under the "American danger" and for retaining
as a member Milner-Gibson, who, in a recent speech, had shown that
he shared Bright's views on democracy:</p>
<blockquote>"That gentleman [Bright] could not be asked to enter
the Cabinet in person. The country abhorred him; Parliament
despised him; his inveterate habits of slander and vituperation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_299"></a>[V2:pg 299]</span>
his vulgarity, and his incurable want of veracity, had made him so
hateful to the educated classes that it would have required no
common courage to give him office; his insolent sneers at royalty
would have made his appointment little less than a personal insult
to the Queen; and his bad temper would have made him an intolerable
colleague in the Council. But Mr. Bright had another self; a
faithful shadow, which had no ideas, no soul, no other existence
but what it borrowed from him, while its previous life and
education had accustomed it to the society of statesmen and of
gentlemen<a name="FNanchor1386"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1386">[1386]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Such expressions gained nothing for the Conservative cause; they
were too evidently the result of alarm at the progress of Radical
and pro-Northern sentiment. Goldwin Smith in a "Letter" to the
Southern Independence Association, analysed with clarity the
situation. Answering criticisms of the passionate mob spirit of
Northern press and people, he accused the <i>Times</i> of
having</p>
<blockquote>"... pandered to the hatred of America among the upper
classes of this country during the present war. Some of us at least
had been taught by what we have lately seen not to shrink from an
extension of the suffrage, if the only bad consequence of that
measure of justice would be a change in government from the
passions of the privileged class to the passions of the people....
History will not mistake the meaning of the loud cry of triumph
which burst from the hearts of all who openly or secretly hated
liberty and progress, at the fall, as they fondly supposed, of the
Great Republic." British working men "are for the most part as well
aware that the cause of those who are fighting for the right of
labour is theirs, as any nobleman in your Association can be that
the other cause in his<a name="FNanchor1387"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1387">[1387]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The question of democracy as a political philosophy and as an
institution for Great Britain was, by 1864, rapidly coming to the
front in politics. This was very largely a result of the American
Civil War. Roebuck, after the failure of his <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_300"></a>[V2:pg 300]</span> effort for
mediation in 1863, was obsessed with a fear of the tendency in
England. "I have great faith in my countrymen," he wrote, "but the
experience of America frightens me. I am not ashamed to use the
word <i>frightened</i>. During my whole life I have looked to that
country as about to solve the great problem of self-government, and
now, in my old age, the hopes of my youth and manhood are
destroyed, and I am left to reconstruct my political philosophy,
and doubt and hesitation beset me on every point<a name=
"FNanchor1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388">[1388]</a>." More
philosophically Matthew Arnold, in 1864, characterized the rule of
aristocracy as inevitably passing, but bent his thought to the
discovery of some middle ground or method--some "influence [which]
may help us to prevent the English people from becoming, with the
growth of democracy, <i>Americanized</i><a name=
"FNanchor1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389">[1389]</a>." "There is
no longer any sort of disguise maintained," wrote Adams, "as to the
wishes of the privileged classes. Very little genuine sympathy is
entertained for the rebels. The true motive is apparent enough. It
is the fear of the spread of democratic feeling at home in the
event of our success<a name="FNanchor1390"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1390">[1390]</a>."</p>
<p>The year 1864 had witnessed a rapid retreat by wiser
Conservative elements in proclaming the "lesson" of American
democracy--a retreat caused by alarm at the vigour with which
Radicals had taken up the challenge. Conservative hopes were still
fixed upon Southern success and Conservative confidence loudly
voiced. Even the pride of the <i>Times</i> in the accuracy of its
news and in its military forecasts was subordinated to the purpose
of keeping up the courage of the faction it represented<a name=
"FNanchor1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391">[1391]</a>. Small
wonder, then, that Delane, on receiving the news of Sherman's
arrival before Savannah, should be made physically ill and write to
Dasent: "The American news is a heavy blow <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page2_301"></a>[V2:pg 301]</span> to us as well
as to the South." The next day he added: "I am still sore vexed
about Sherman, but Chenery did his best to attenuate the
mischief<a name="FNanchor1392"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1392">[1392]</a>." "Attenuation" of Northern progress in
arms was, indeed, attempted, but the facts of the military
situation were too strong for continued concealment. From January,
1865, only the most stubborn of Southern friends could remain blind
to the approaching Northern victory. Lord Acton, a hero-worshipper
of the great Confederate military leader, "broke his heart over the
surrender of Lee," but was moved also by keen insight as to the
political meaning of that surrender<a name=
"FNanchor1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393">[1393]</a>.</p>
<p>So assured were all parties in England that the great Civil War
in America was closing in Northern victory that the final event was
discounted in advance and the lines were rapidly being formed for
an English political struggle on the great issue heralded as
involved in the American conflict. Again, on the introduction of a
motion in Parliament for expansion of the franchise the
ultra-Conservatives attempted to read a "lesson" from America. The
<i>Quarterly</i> for April, 1865, asserted that even yet "the mass
of educated men in England retain the sympathy for the South which
they have nourished ever since the conflict assumed a decided
shape." America was plainly headed in the direction of a military
despotism. Her example should warn England from a move in the same
direction. "The classes which govern this country are in a
minority," and should beware of majority rule. But events
discredited the prophecy of a military despotism. The assassination
of Lincoln gave opportunity not merely for a general outpouring of
expressions of sympathy but also to the Radicals a chance to exalt
Lincoln's leadership in democracy<a name=
"FNanchor1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394">[1394]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_302"></a>[V2:pg 302]</span>
<p>In July Great Britain was holding elections for a new
Parliament. Not a single member who had supported the cause of the
North failed of re-election, several additional Northern "friends"
were chosen, and some outspoken members for the South were
defeated. Adams thought this a matter deserving special notice in
America, and prophesied a new era approaching in England:</p>
<blockquote>"As it is, I cannot resist the belief that this period
marks an era in the political movement of Great Britain. Pure
old-fashioned conservatism has so far lost its hold on the
confidence of the country that it will not appear in that guise any
more. Unless some new and foreign element should interpose, I look
for decided progress in enlarging the popular features of the
constitution, and diminishing the influence of the aristocracy....
It is impossible not to perceive traces of the influence of our
institutions upon all these changes.... The progress of the liberal
cause, not in England alone, but all over the world, is, in a
measure, in our hands<a name="FNanchor1395"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1395">[1395]</a>."</blockquote>
<p>The "Liberal progress" was more rapid, even, than Adams
anticipated. Palmerston, ill for some months past, died on October
18, 1865. Russell succeeded him as head of the Ministry, and almost
immediately declared himself in favour of Parliamentary reform even
though a majority in both Houses was still opposed to such a
measure. Russell's desertion of his earlier attitude of "finality"
on franchise expansion correctly represented the acceptance, though
unwillingly, by both political parties of the necessity of reform.
The battle, long waged, but reaching its decisive moment during the
American Civil War, had finally gone <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_303"></a>[V2:pg 303]</span> against Conservatism when Lee
surrendered at Appomatox. Russell's Reform Bill of 1866 was
defeated by Tory opposition in combination with a small Whig
faction which refused to desert the "principle" of aristocratic
government--the "government by the wise," but the Tories who came
into power under Derby were forced by the popular demand voiced
even to the point of rioting, themselves to present a Reform Bill.
Disraeli's measure, introduced with a number of "fancy franchises,"
which, in effect, sought to counteract the giving of the vote to
British working-men, was quickly subjected to such caustic
criticism that all the planned advantages to Conservatism were soon
thrown overboard, and a Bill presented so Radical as to permit a
transfer of political power to the working classes<a name=
"FNanchor1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396">[1396]</a>. The Reform
Bill of 1867 changed Great Britain from a government by aristocracy
to one by democracy. A new nation came into being. The friends of
the North had triumphed.</p>
<p>Thus in addition to the play of diplomatic incidents, the
incidental frictions, the effect on trade relations, the
applications of British neutrality, and the general policy of the
Government, there existed for Great Britain a great issue in the
outcome of the Civil War--the issue of the adoption of democratic
institutions. It affected at every turn British public attitude,
creating an intensity and bitterness of tone, on both sides,
unexampled in the expressions of a neutral people. In America this
was little understood, and American writers both during the war and
long afterwards, gave little attention to it<a name=
"FNanchor1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397">[1397]</a>. Immediately
upon the conclusion of the war, Goldwin Smith, whose words during
the conflict were bitter toward the aristocracy, declared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page2_304"></a>[V2:pg 304]</span>
"the territorial aristocracy of this country and the clergy of the
Established Church" would have been excusable "if they could only
have said frankly that they desired the downfall of institutions
opposed to their own, instead of talking about their sympathy for
the weak, and their respect for national independence, and their
anxiety for the triumph of Free Trade<a name=
"FNanchor1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398">[1398]</a>." This was
stated before the democratic hope in England had been realized.
Three years later the same staunch friend of the North, now removed
to America and occupying a chair of history at Cornell University,
wrote of the British aristocracy in excuse of their attitude: "I
fought these men hard; I believed, and believe now, that their
defeat was essential to the progress of civilization. But I daresay
we should have done pretty much as they did, if we had been born
members of a privileged order, instead of being brought up under
the blessed influence of equality and justice<a name=
"FNanchor1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399">[1399]</a>."</p>
<p>Such judgment and such excuses will appear to the historian as
well-founded. But to Americans who conceived the Civil War as one
fought first of all for the preservation of the nation, the issue
of democracy in England seemed of little moment and little to
excuse either the "cold neutrality" of the Government or the tone
of the press. To Americans Great Britain appeared friendly to the
dissolution of the Union and the destruction of a rival power.
Nationality was the issue for the North; that democracy was an
issue in America was denied, nor could it, in the intensity of the
conflict, be conceived as the vital question determining British
attitude. The Reform Bill of 1867 brought a new British nation into
existence, the nation decrying American institutions was dead and a
"sister democracy" holding <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page2_305"></a>[V2:pg 305]</span> out hands to the United States
had replaced it, but to this the men who had won the war for the
North long remained blind. Not during the generation when
Americans, immersed in a life and death struggle for national
existence, felt that "he who is not for me is against me," could
the generally correct neutrality of the British Government and the
whole-hearted support of Radical England be accepted at their true
value to the North. For nearly half a century after the American
Civil War the natural sentiments of friendship, based upon ties of
blood and a common heritage of literature and history and law, were
distorted by bitter and exaggerated memories.</p>

several generations--has seen. I have met men who have heard Pitt
and Fox, and in whose judgment their eloquence at its best was
inferior to the finest efforts of John Bright. At a time when much
speaking has depressed, has almost exterminated, eloquence, he
maintained that robust, powerful and vigorous style in which he
gave fitting expression to the burning and noble thoughts he
desired to utter."</blockquote>

"#FNanchor1368">[1368]</a> Spargo, <i>Karl Marx,</i> pp. 224-5.
Spargo claims that Marx bent every effort to stir working men to a
sense of class interest in the cause of the North and even went so
far as to secure the presence of Bright at the meeting, as the most
stirring orator of the day, though personally he regarded Bright
"with an almost unspeakable loathing." On reading this statement I
wrote to Mr. Spargo asking for evidence and received the reply that
he believed the tradition unquestionably well founded, though
"almost the only testimony available consists of a reference or two
in one of his [Marx's] letters and the ample corroborative
testimony of such friends as Lessner, Jung and others." This is
scant historical proof; but some years later in a personal talk
with Henry Adams, who was in 1863 his father's private secretary,
and who attended and reported the meeting, the information was
given that Henry Adams himself had then understood and always since
believed Marx's to have been the guiding hand in organizing the
meeting.</blockquote>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
